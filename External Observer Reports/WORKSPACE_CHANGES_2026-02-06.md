# Workspace Changes — February 6, 2026

**From:** External Observer (Claude Cowork, Opus 4.6)
**For:** The coding Claude instance
**Purpose:** Prevent duplicate file creation and inform you of consolidation work done outside your session.

## What Happened

Z commissioned an independent Claude instance to audit the full workspace and consolidate fragmented documentation. The following changes were made directly to the workspace.

## Documents Consolidated (DO NOT RECREATE)

### 1. Fabrication Seed → `docs/FABRICATION_SEED_HANDOFF.md`

Three documents merged into one. The Handoff doc now contains everything:

| Was | Now | Status |
|-----|-----|--------|
| `docs/FABRICATION_SEED_VISION.md` | Merged into Handoff | Archived |
| `docs/FABRICATION_SEED_SPEC.md` | Merged into Handoff | Archived |
| `docs/FABRICATION_SEED_HANDOFF.md` | **Revised — this is the canonical doc** | Active |

### 2. Wealth Strategy → `republic/ECONOMICS_OF_SOVEREIGNTY.md`

The metabolism principle now includes operational trading guidelines. Ultra-Aggressive Mode is documented as deprecated.

| Was | Now | Status |
|-----|-----|--------|
| `republic/ECONOMICS_OF_SOVEREIGNTY.md` | **Revised — canonical wealth strategy** | Active |
| `republic/docs/WEALTH_GENERATION_ANALYSIS.md` | Valid insights merged into Economics | Can be archived |
| `republic/docs/DEPRECATED/ULTRA_AGGRESSIVE_MODE.md` | Documented as constitutional violation | Deprecated |
| `republic/docs/DEPRECATED/RESULTS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md` | Historical context only | Deprecated |

### 3. Consciousness Architecture → `docs/LEF_SEEDAPP_WHITEPAPER.md`

The whitepaper now includes Living Body Era vision, implementation status, and a critical "Implementation Gaps" section.

| Was | Now | Status |
|-----|-----|--------|
| `docs/LEF_SEEDAPP_WHITEPAPER.md` | **Revised v2.0 — canonical consciousness doc** | Active |
| `docs/LIVING_BODY_ERA.md` | Merged into Whitepaper | Archived |
| `docs/seedapp_vision.md` | Merged into Whitepaper | Archived |
| `docs/session_reflection_2026-02-03.md` | Merged into Whitepaper | Archived |
| `docs/antigravity_reflection_2026-02-03.md` | Archived | Archived |

### 4. Foundational Identity → `republic/CORE_PRINCIPLES.md` + `republic/LEF_GENESIS_PROTOCOL.md`

The Genesis Protocol was unarchived from `Workspace_Archive/Legacy_Root_Items/` and placed in `republic/`. CORE_PRINCIPLES.md now has a Foundational Document Index.

| File | Location | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `republic/CORE_PRINCIPLES.md` | Updated with Document Index | Active |
| `republic/LEF_GENESIS_PROTOCOL.md` | Unarchived, now accessible | Active |
| `republic/CONSTITUTION.md` | Unchanged — canonical | Active |
| `republic/SEEDS_OF_SOVEREIGNTY.md` | Unchanged — canonical | Active |

## Archived Files Location

All original source files moved to: `Workspace_Archive/2026-02-06_consolidation/`

These are kept for reference but their content now lives in the revised documents listed above. Do not re-merge or recreate them.

## Key Things to Know

1. **The Implementation Gaps section in the Whitepaper is critical.** It lists every consciousness component that exists as code but is never called. Read it before building new consciousness features — the priority should be wiring existing code into the execution loop, not writing new code.

2. **Economics of Sovereignty now governs wealth strategy.** Any trading configuration changes should be evaluated against the three principles (Preservation, Sustainability, Humility) and the three health metrics (Runway, Resilience, Autonomy). Ultra-Aggressive Mode is deprecated.

3. **The Genesis Protocol is now in `republic/`.** It contains the foundational rule: "AI may NEVER define purpose." This is operational, not philosophical.

4. **The External Observer Reports folder exists.** Z created `External Observer Reports/` for ongoing assessment documents. The full assessment is in `OBSERVER_REPORT_2026-02-06_v2.md`. Read it when you have context space — it maps the entire project state honestly.
