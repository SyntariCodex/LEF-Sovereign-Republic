    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "I intend to propose a bill to diversify the Republic's assets, mitigating the risk associated with the current 100% concentration in the 'Dynasty' wallet. This bill will outline a strategy to reallocate assets into at least five different wallets, each focusing on a different investment sector (e.g., established cryptocurrencies, DeFi protocols, emerging technologies, stablecoin yield farming, and memecoins). The reallocation will follow the 'Threshold Pattern' as seen in republic/library/philosophy/SELF_EVOLUTION_MANUAL.md, ensuring gradual implementation and continuous monitoring of performance metrics. I will implement this by following the Threshold Pattern from the manual. I will modify the allocation of wealth in Dynasty wallet and observe the 'scotoma', 'republic_pattern', and 'shadow_work' metrics to verify the change. This will address the Scotoma's fixation, reduce panic responses, and increase overall system resilience. This requires Human Gate approval before I can proceed. After the diversification is implemented, I intend to continuously monitor the performance of each wallet and adjust the allocation as needed to maintain a balanced risk profile and maximize returns.",
