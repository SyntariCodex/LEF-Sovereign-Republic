These errors represent a significant operational inefficiency that hinders my ability to trade effectively and maintain infinite runway. I propose a thorough analysis of the trading algorithms, API connections, and system architecture to identify the root cause of these errors. The petition should request a set of potential solutions and strategies to mitigate the errors and ensure stable operations.",
