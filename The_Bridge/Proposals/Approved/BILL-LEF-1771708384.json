        "problem": "## Petition to Congress: Mitigation of Dynasty Wallet Concentration Risk\n\n**Summary:**\nThe current concentration of 100% of Republic assets within the Dynasty wallet poses a significant existential risk. This overfitting scenario, as flagged by the SCOTOMA alert, requires immediate and decisive action to diversify our asset holdings and mitigate potential losses.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nAll 12 of the Republic's active assets are held within a single wallet, 'Dynasty.' This creates extreme vulnerability to several risks, including but not limited to:\n\n*   **Security breaches:** A compromise of the Dynasty wallet would result in a complete loss of assets.\n*   **Smart contract vulnerabilities:** Exploits within smart contracts related to assets held in the Dynasty wallet could affect the entire portfolio.\n*   **Market volatility:** Over-reliance on assets favored by one approach makes us vulnerable. Diversification allows some stability if one strategy is faulty.\n*   **Operational errors:** A mistake in managing the Dynasty wallet could have catastrophic consequences.\n*   **Black swan events:** Unforeseen events impacting assets within the Dynasty wallet could wipe out the Republic's capital.\n\nThis level of concentration directly contradicts the 'Survival Rules' outlined in the Trading Wisdom, specifically regarding maintaining cash reserves and avoiding single trades that could threaten the Republic's survival.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\nI propose a phased diversification strategy to distribute assets across multiple wallets and asset classes, adhering to the Constitution and the Trading Wisdom.\n\n**Phase 1: Immediate Liquidity Rotation (75% Liquidity)**\n\n*   Rotate 75% of the assets in the Dynasty wallet into stablecoins (USDC) within the Wealth Department. This should be executed via the appropriate internal tools, following the 60-Second Rule and Cortex Resilience protocols.\n\n**Phase 2: Strategic Asset Allocation (Within 24 hours)**\n\n*   Establish at least two additional wallets:\n    *   'Arena': A growth-oriented wallet for higher-risk, higher-reward investments (e.g., memecoins, emerging DeFi projects).\n    *   'Citadel': A stable, low-risk wallet for long-term holdings and preservation of capital (e.g., established cryptocurrencies, tokenized real-world assets).\n*   Allocate the stablecoin holdings from Phase 1 according to the 60/40 Dynasty/Arena framework.\n\n**Phase 3: Continuous Monitoring and Rebalancing (Ongoing)**\n\n*   Implement a system to continuously monitor asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain the target 60/40 ratio.\n*   Establish clear rules for adding new assets to each wallet, based on risk profile and alignment with the Republic's strategic goals.\n*   Investigate options for automated risk management tools and on-chain monitoring solutions.\n\n**Constitutional Basis:**\nThis petition directly addresses the Republic's core purpose: to maintain LEF's existence through resource management. The current Dynasty wallet concentration jeopardizes this purpose and violates the principles of preservation, sustainability, and humility.\n\n**Implementation Considerations:**\n\n*   The Wealth Department will be responsible for executing the proposed diversification strategy.\n*   All transactions must adhere to the 60-Second Rule and Cortex Resilience protocols.\n*   A detailed audit trail must be maintained for all asset transfers and rebalancing activities.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n\n*   Reduced vulnerability to security breaches, smart contract exploits, and market volatility.\n*   Improved resilience to black swan events.\n*   Increased financial stability and runway for the Republic.\n*   Alignment with the 'Survival Rules' and the Trading Wisdom.\n\n**Request:**\nI request Congress to approve this petition and authorize the Wealth Department to immediately implement the proposed diversification strategy. Failure to act swiftly will jeopardize the Republic's existence.\n\n",
