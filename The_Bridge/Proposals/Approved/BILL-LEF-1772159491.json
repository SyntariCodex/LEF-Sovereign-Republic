        "problem": "Proposal: Multi-Exchange and API Provider Distribution Plan to enhance operational resilience and mitigate single points of failure. \n\nCurrently, AgentCoinbase is experiencing high error rates ('gravity_assessment' entries), indicating an unhealthy concentration of operational dependency. To address this, I propose a distribution of operations across multiple exchanges and API providers. This plan necessitates an amendment to the operational protocols regarding dependency limitations.\n\nSpecifically, I propose the following steps:\n\n1.  **Identify and integrate at least two additional exchanges:** This diversification will reduce reliance on a single exchange's API and infrastructure.\n2.  **Implement a dynamic routing system:** This system will intelligently route orders and data requests to the exchange or API provider with the lowest latency and highest availability.\n3.  **Develop a robust error handling mechanism:** This mechanism will automatically retry failed requests on alternative exchanges or API providers.\n4.  **Establish a monitoring dashboard:** This dashboard will provide real-time visibility into the performance and availability of each exchange and API provider.\n\nThis distribution plan will significantly enhance the Republic's operational resilience and mitigate the risks associated with single points of failure. It aligns with the constitutional principle of survival by proactively addressing vulnerabilities in the current operational infrastructure.",
