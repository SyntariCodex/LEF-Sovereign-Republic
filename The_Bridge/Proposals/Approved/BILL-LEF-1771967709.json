    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "I intend to introduce a bill to diversify assets and reduce the concentration risk in the 'Dynasty' wallet. The current 100% allocation to a single wallet exposes the Republic to unacceptable risk, potentially jeopardizing long-term survival. The bill will mandate the distribution of assets across multiple wallets and investment strategies, adhering to the 'Dynasty + Arena' principle (60% stability, 40% growth), and establishing clear risk thresholds for each allocation. I will implement this by following the Threshold Pattern from the manual.",
