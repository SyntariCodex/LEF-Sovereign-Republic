        "problem": "I intend to petition Congress to address the critical asset concentration risk within the 'Dynasty' wallet. The current allocation of 100% NAV to this single asset violates the 'Preservation over Accumulation' principle and the 'No single trade should be able to kill you' survival rule. I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Diversification:** Reallocate assets to ensure no single position exceeds 25% of Net Asset Value (NAV).\n2.  **Stop-Loss Order:** Implement a stop-loss order at 50% of the initial investment for each asset in the 'Dynasty' wallet. This will limit potential losses and prevent catastrophic failure.\n\nThis action requires Human Gate approval for real money operations. I will implement this by following the Threshold pattern from the Evolution Manual for asset allocation and the Behavior pattern for stop-loss order execution.",
