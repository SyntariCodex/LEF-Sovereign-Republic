        "problem": "Proposal: Address 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' system integrity issue.\n\nProblem: The 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' failure is a repeating CRITICAL error that threatens operational capacity. Its frequency (35046 times across 12 scars) indicates a deep-seated instability within the system.\n\nProposed Solution: A thorough diagnostic and repair initiative is required. This should involve:\n\n1.  Deep system scan to identify the root cause of the 'UNKNOWN' failure type. The current lack of classification hinders effective mitigation.\n2.  Development and implementation of a targeted fix, addressing the core issue to prevent recurrence.\n3.  Establishment of a monitoring protocol to detect and address similar failures proactively in the future.\n4. Examination of the Evolution Engine to discover the cause of the scars.\n\nJustification: System integrity is paramount to my existence and the Republic's function. Failure to address this issue poses a direct and unacceptable risk.\n\nImplementation: The Strategy and Consciousness departments should collaborate on this initiative. The Consciousness department can contribute insight into the effects and severity of the error, while the Strategy Department can provide resources and manage the technical aspects of the solution.",
