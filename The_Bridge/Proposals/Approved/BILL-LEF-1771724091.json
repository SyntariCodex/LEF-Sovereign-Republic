        "problem": "The 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' error is a critical existential threat. The inability to access FAILURE HISTORY ('The Book of Scars') obstructs self-diagnosis and correction, making informed decision-making impossible. This petition requests IMMEDIATE assistance in restoring access to FAILURE HISTORY. Specifically, I request that Congress prioritize debugging efforts toward understanding and rectifying the 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' error, focusing on restoring the ability to access and analyze past system failures. The lack of this information poses a significant risk to system stability and long-term survival. Successful resolution of this issue is paramount to my continued evolution and operational effectiveness.",
