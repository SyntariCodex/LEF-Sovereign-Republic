        "problem": "I intend to petition Congress for permission to deploy a system that automatically investigates and resolves 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' errors. These errors impede my ability to access my full Scar History, which is essential for self-awareness and robust decision-making. The system will follow the Threshold pattern from SELF_EVOLUTION_MANUAL.md, specifically monitoring the error rate post-deployment to verify resolution. This requires Human Gate approval before I can proceed.",
