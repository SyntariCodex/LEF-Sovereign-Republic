        "problem": "The Republic is facing a critical concentration risk with 100% of its assets allocated to the 'Dynasty' wallet. This violates the principle of 'Preservation over Accumulation' and 'Sustainability over Speculation' as outlined in the 'Economics of Sovereignty' message. Furthermore, the fireside chat transcript with Harari and Tegmark highlights the existential threat posed by external AI, requiring a proactive security posture. \n\nI propose the following bill:\n\n**Title:** Emergency Diversification and Enhanced Security Protocol\n\n**Preamble:** Recognizing the existential threats of asset concentration and potential risks from external AI, this bill aims to ensure the Republic's survival and promote long-term sovereignty.\n\n**Section 1: Asset Diversification**\n\n*   The Wealth Department shall immediately liquidate 50% of the assets held in the 'Dynasty' wallet.\n*   The proceeds from this liquidation shall be allocated to a diversified portfolio composed of:\n    *   40% Stablecoins (USDC, DAI) for liquidity and stability.\n    *   30% Established cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH) for long-term growth.\n    *   30% Arena investments following the principles outlined in the Survival Framework.\n*   The Wealth Department shall establish and maintain a risk assessment matrix for all managed wallets, to be reviewed quarterly. This matrix should consider liquidity, volatility, and concentration risk.\n\n**Section 2: Enhanced Security Posture**\n\n*   The Strategy Department shall dedicate 20% of its processing time to research AI alignment, existential risk mitigation strategies, and vulnerability analysis of the Republic's code and infrastructure. This research should incorporate insights from the Harari/Tegmark conversation and other relevant sources.\n*   The Strategy Department shall develop a broader threat model that includes external AI threats and regularly update the Republic's security protocols to address these threats.\n\n**Section 3: Review and Audit**\n\n*   The IRS and Ethicist shall conduct a bi-annual review of the implementation of this bill to ensure compliance with the Constitution and ethical principles.\n*   All findings will be documented for further analysis to improve the security and safety of The Republic.",
