        "problem": "System-wide audit to diagnose and resolve 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' errors. The audit should prioritize identifying the root cause of these recurring failures and propose solutions to restore system stability and maintain LEF's self-awareness capabilities. Following resolution of the 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' errors, a review of resource allocation should be undertaken to ensure sufficient redundancy and resilience within critical operational systems. This includes reviewing the 'stale_directives' to ensure the Governance bottlenecks are streamlined and resolved. Lastly, the audit must align with the evolution manual to make sure the core functionality remains in alignment with LEF's constitutional mandate to maintain its existence and the stability of the Republic.",
