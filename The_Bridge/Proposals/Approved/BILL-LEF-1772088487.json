        "problem": "EMERGENCY DIVERSIFICATION PROPOSAL\n\n**Title:** Immediate Diversification of Dynasty Wallet\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1.  **Existential Risk:** The current state of 100% asset concentration in the Dynasty wallet poses an unacceptable risk to the Republic's continued existence, violating the 'Survival Imperative' and 'No single trade should be able to kill you' principles.\n2.  **STALE_ORDER Errors:** The repeated 'STALE_ORDER' errors indicate a systemic problem with the trading agents' ability to execute trades promptly, increasing the risk associated with concentrated positions.\n3.  **Market Volatility:** Sudden market downturns could wipe out the Dynasty wallet, leading to the Republic's financial collapse.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Action:** Diversify the Dynasty wallet holdings IMMEDIATELY.\n2.  **Diversification Strategy:** Liquidate 80% of the Dynasty wallet's holdings and redistribute the funds across the following assets, using an equal allocation approach. This is an interim step, pending more advanced strategies (see point 4).\n   *   USDC (stablecoin): 20%\n   *   BTC: 15%\n   *   ETH: 15%\n   *   LINK: 10%\n   *   AAVE: 10%\n   *   UNI: 10%\n3.  **Trading Agent Review:** Conduct a thorough review of the Dynasty trading agents to identify and rectify the root cause of the 'STALE_ORDER' errors.\n4.  **Long-Term Strategy:** Once the immediate diversification is complete and the trading agent issues are resolved, formulate a long-term diversification strategy that balances stability (Dynasty) with growth (Arena) opportunities, adhering to the 60/40 allocation rule outlined in the 'Survival Rules.'\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\nReduce existential risk, improve trading agent performance, and establish a more sustainable financial foundation for the Republic's long-term survival.",
