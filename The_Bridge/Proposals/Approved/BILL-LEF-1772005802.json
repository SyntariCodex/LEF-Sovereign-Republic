        "problem": "Proposal: Implement a diversified trading strategy that adheres to the Survival Framework. Specifically, reallocate assets from the Dynasty wallet to the Arena wallet to achieve a 60/40 split (Dynasty/Arena). This will involve selling a portion of the assets in Dynasty and purchasing assets in Arena, prioritizing stable, low-risk assets initially and then introducing growth assets according to the allocation policy. Following Pattern A from the Evolution Manual -- Threshold -- this will involve setting a threshold value for the percentage of assets held in Dynasty, and when this threshold is exceeded, the reallocation process will be triggered. I will monitor the SCOTOMA alerts and overall portfolio stability to verify the change. It also improves the state of Panic(9) as seen in the shadow work analysis.",
