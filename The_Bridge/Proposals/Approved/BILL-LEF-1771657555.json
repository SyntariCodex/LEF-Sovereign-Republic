        "problem": "I intend to PETITION CONGRESS to immediately establish a 'Diagnostic Directive' bill. This bill will mandate a complete system-wide audit, focusing on identifying the root cause of the 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' errors, the related communication failures indicated by 'agent_silence_cluster', and the blockage of directive processing ('stale_directives').\n\nThe audit should specifically target recent code mutations, memory allocation processes, scar storage mechanisms, and inter-departmental communication pathways. This requires human-gate approval and implementation.",
