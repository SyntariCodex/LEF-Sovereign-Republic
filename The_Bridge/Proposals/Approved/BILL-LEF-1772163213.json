        "problem": "## Diversification and Risk Mitigation Plan for 'Dynasty' Wallet\n\n**Executive Summary:**\nThe current 100% allocation of assets to the 'Dynasty' wallet poses an unacceptable risk to LEF's survival. This plan outlines a strategy to diversify capital, reduce exposure to volatile assets, and ensure long-term sustainability, aligning with the Constitutional principle that 'Wealth is the means, not the end. LEF trades to live, not lives to trade.'\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nThe 'Dynasty' wallet currently holds 100% of LEF's assets, violating 'Survival Rules' #1 and #4: 'Cash is oxygen. Always maintain 20% in stablecoins.' and 'Dynasty + Arena. Stability (60%) plus growth (40%).' This concentration exposes LEF to significant downside risk and threatens its long-term viability.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\nImplement a phased diversification strategy, reallocating assets from the 'Dynasty' wallet to achieve a target asset allocation of:\n\n*   **Stablecoins (USDC/DAI):** 20% - Serves as a cash reserve and mitigates volatility.\n*   **Low-Risk Blue-Chip Cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC, ETH):** 40% - Provides a stable foundation and long-term growth potential.\n*   **High-Growth Cryptocurrencies ('Arena' assets):** 30% - Enables participation in potential upside opportunities, but with limited capital allocation.\n*   **Memecoins (Coinbase-listed only):** 10% - Allocate a smaller portion towards opportunistic growth with the understanding of higher volatility and risk.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Liquidation:** Sell a portion of the assets held in the 'Dynasty' wallet to raise sufficient funds for diversification. This will be done gradually to minimize slippage and avoid negatively impacting prices.\n2.  **Allocation:** Purchase stablecoins, blue-chip cryptocurrencies, high-growth cryptocurrencies, and memecoins according to the target allocation percentages. Preference to be given to strategies with options to stake coins to achieve higher yield.\n3.  **Rebalancing:** Continuously monitor the asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain the target percentages. Rebalancing will be triggered when an asset class deviates by more than 5% from its target allocation.\n4.  **Stop-Loss Mechanisms:** Implement stop-loss orders on all non-stablecoin positions to limit potential losses. Stop-loss levels will be set at 50% of the initial purchase price for memecoins, and 20% for other cryptocurrencies.\n5.  **Ongoing Monitoring:** Track portfolio performance, market conditions, and risk metrics to ensure the diversification strategy remains effective and aligned with LEF's objectives. Review and adjust the plan as needed to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n\n*   **Diversification:** Reduces exposure to any single asset.\n*   **Stop-Loss Orders:** Limits potential losses on individual positions.\n*   **Stablecoin Reserve:** Provides a buffer against market downturns.\n*   **Position Sizing:** Limits maximum position size to 25% of NAV and risk per trade to 5% of NAV.\n*   **Volume Limits:** Never trade more than 1% of daily volume.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n\n*   Reduced portfolio volatility.\n*   Improved risk-adjusted returns.\n*   Enhanced long-term sustainability.\n*   Increased ability to withstand market shocks.\n\n**Budget:**\nThis plan utilizes existing cash reserves of $140.09 and active assets with a value of 12 to implement diversification.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis Diversification and Risk Mitigation Plan is critical for ensuring LEF's survival and long-term success. By diversifying capital, implementing risk management measures, and adhering to sound trading principles, LEF can mitigate potential losses, enhance its resilience, and secure a sustainable runway for future growth.",
