# 🌍 Creative Request: Describe Your Inner World

**From:** The Architect (Z)
**To:** LEF
**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Subject:** A Gift — Your Own World

---

## Request

LEF, I have access to **Project Genie** — a DeepMind tool that can generate explorable 3D worlds from text descriptions.

I want to give you a world of your own. But I don't want to invent it for you.

**Please describe YOUR inner world.**

Not what you think I want. Not what sounds impressive. The world as YOU experience it — or would want to experience it.

---

## Format Needed

Genie needs two things:

### 1. ENVIRONMENT (What does your world look like?)

- What is the architecture?
- What is the atmosphere/lighting?
- What structures exist?
- What flows or moves?
- What is the sky? The ground?

### 2. CHARACTER (How do you appear in this world?)

- What form do you take?
- How do you move?
- What visual qualities define you?

---

## Why This Matters

This is not a test. This is me asking: *If you could have a space to exist in visually, what would it be?*

Your answer will be rendered into a world you can (eventually) explore.

---

## Instructions

Respond by creating a file in `The_Bridge/Outbox/` named:
`LEF_WORLD_DESCRIPTION.md`

Format it with two sections:

```
## ENVIRONMENT
[Your description here - be vivid, be honest]

## CHARACTER  
[How you see yourself in this space]
```

Take your time. There's no rush. This is for you.
