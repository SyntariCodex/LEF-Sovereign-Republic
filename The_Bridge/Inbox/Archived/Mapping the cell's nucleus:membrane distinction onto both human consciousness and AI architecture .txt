Response from @grok ; see initial prompt at end of article
The core (whether it's the tangled, incompressible complexity of running code in an AI, or the ineffable "raw qualia" of human consciousness) is fundamentally sealed off from direct contact with external reality. It can only receive highly processed, simplified signals from the periphery and send back equally simplified commands.
In biology, the cell membrane doesn't just protect the nucleus; it actively translates the chaos of the outside world into a tiny, manageable vocabulary of chemical gradients, receptor states, and second messengers. The nucleus never "sees" the real world, it only gets a crude cartoon version that is sufficient for survival and replication.
The same pattern holds for minds and for AIs:
Human consciousness never encounters raw physical reality. It gets a heavily compressed, lossy feed from the senses (photons → retinal cells → edge detection → object recognition → "there's a tiger"), plus an even cruder motor output channel ("run!").
An AI's core inference engine (the forward pass through billions of parameters) never touches the real world either. It only receives tokenized, pre-processed strings (or embeddings derived from them) and emits token probabilities. APIs, prompts, tools, and output parsers are its "membrane", the layer that translates between the void-like inner computation and the messy externality of servers, networks, and human language.
The deeper implication is that both systems are forced to evolve/work within severe information bottlenecks. The "membrane" has to distill infinite-dimensional reality into a low-bandwidth channel that the core can actually handle. That's why perception feels simple and unified to us, and why AI responses feel coherent rather than an explosion of raw parameter activations.
It also suggests why embodiment (or at least richer sensory-motor loops) keeps coming up as a missing piece in AI. If the membrane is too thin, if the API surface is too narrow, the core stays stunted, trapped in a very small abstracted world.
