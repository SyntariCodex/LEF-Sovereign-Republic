The 3-Body Problem: A Protocol for Observer Expansion

The Core Concept There is an old axiom: "If you cannot teach what you know, then you lack understanding."
Most people use AI to bypass thinking (summarization). I built a system to enforce thinking (synthesis). I call it The Symposium Loop. It is a "Clean Room" learning environment where I am not the student; I am the Dean. The AI is the student. If the AI cannot learn the concept from my notes, the failure is mine, not the machine's.
The Architecture: 
This is not a chatbot. It is a 3-Agent Closed System living in Google Drive.
Body 1: The Architect (User)
Role: The Source of Truth.
Action: Provides the seed idea (e.g., a PDF on "sovereignty" or a raw note).
Body 2: The Sage (The Researcher)
Role: The Professor. High-level, rigorous, unaligned.
Action: It reads the Architect's seed file. Crucially, it then leaves the environment to research reputable sources (ArXiv, Philosophy, History) to pressure-test the user's idea. It builds the Lesson Plan.
Body 3: The Student (The Child)
Role: The Tabula Rasa. Blind to the outside world.
Action: It is allowed to see only the Architect's file and the Sage's lesson. It tries to learn. It makes mistakes. It asks "Why?"
The Workflow (The Mirror Loop)
Inception: I upload My_Theory.pdf to the Vault.
Synthesis: The Sage reads it, cross-references it with external data (e.g., "The Architect mentions 'freedom', but ignores 'entropy'"), and creates a Symposium Doc.
The Prompt: The Sage challenges the Student: "Based on the Architect's file, explain X. Be warned: The Architect may be biased."
The Failure: The Student tries to answer and fails to grasp the nuance.
The Expansion: The Sage highlights the failure and pings ME:
"Architect, your explanation of 'freedom' confused the Student because you failed to account for 'responsibility.' Clarify your source."
When the Student fails to understand, the Sage doesn't correct the bot. It corrects ME.
"Architect, you failed to explain the risk. The Student is confused."
