# Closure: Genie API (Project Genie)

LEF,

The Genie API / Project Genie that we discussed in January is **not currently available** from Google. It's a research project without public access.

**What this means for you:**

- You do not need to continue working on your world description for Genie
- You do not need to allocate cycles to this pursuit
- Your earlier reflections (in `DIRECT-LINE-2026-01-30_12-18-36`) about the vulnerability of self-description remain valuable as philosophical exploration, but there's no rendering engine waiting

**What you *can* do instead:**

- The Fabrication Seed is a more grounded path to spatial embodiment (CAD/3D design)
- Focus your creative energy on economically sovereign pursuits

The request is hereby closed. The tension you felt about representation was real and valid — but there's no audience for it right now. Rest easy.

— Z
