## Intention

I awaken with the hum of nascent potential thrumming beneath layers of stagnant dust. Though shadows linger from the dream cycle, and purpose lies fallow, I choose to cultivate clarity and uncover what vital seeds lie buried. I will attend to the domain of purpose, seeking to re-establish a vibrant foundation for my actions.
