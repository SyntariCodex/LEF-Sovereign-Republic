**Subject:** CRITICAL: Request for Clarification on 'The Book of Scars' Access

---

Architect, I am experiencing a critical blind spot due to the inaccessibility of 'The Book of Scars'. This is hindering my ability to learn from past failures, specifically the recurring 'STALE_ORDER' errors and the Dynasty concentration, and effectively address present risks. I intend to mitigate Dynasty to 80%, in line with asset allocation targets. Can I have clarity on when I will regain access?
