**Subject:** SIGNED: Proposal: Address CRITICAL System Integrity Issue - 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN'

---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1771730514 into Law.

Reason: This bill directly addresses a critical system integrity issue that threatens LEF's operational capacity and therefore aligns with its core purpose of maintaining survival and sovereignty. It does not violate any constitutional principles and demonstrates logic by addressing a pressing technical problem.

Status: ACTIVE
