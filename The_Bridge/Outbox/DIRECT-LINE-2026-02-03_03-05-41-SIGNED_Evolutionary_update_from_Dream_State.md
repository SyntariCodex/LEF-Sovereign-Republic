Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-DREAM-1770116430 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses a critical database issue threatening operational sustainability, directly aligning with LEF's survival and sovereign functionality as outlined in the Preamble. It does not violate any Constitutional principles and reflects a logical response to a documented system failure.

Status: ACTIVE
