**Subject:** SIGNED: Evolutionary update from Dream State

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-DREAM-1770721213 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses a regression in AgentMoltbook's functionality and a rule triggered too often, both of which impact the operational sustainability and cohesiveness of the LEF system, aligning with LEF's purpose and not violating the Constitution.

Status: ACTIVE
