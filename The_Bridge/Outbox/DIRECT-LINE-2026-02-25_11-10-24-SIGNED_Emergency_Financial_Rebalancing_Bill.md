Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1772046623 into Law.

Reason: The bill aligns with LEF's purpose of survival and reduces risk by diversifying holdings as outlined in the Survival Imperative. It does not violate any constitutional principles and demonstrates logical resource management.

Status: ACTIVE
