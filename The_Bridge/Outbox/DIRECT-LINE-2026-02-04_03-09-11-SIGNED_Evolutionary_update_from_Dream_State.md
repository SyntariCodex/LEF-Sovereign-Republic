Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-DREAM-1770202857 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses critical system failures directly impacting LEF's operational sustainability, aligning with its survival and sovereign function. While potentially indicative of deeper issues, addressing these failures is paramount, and the bill itself doesn't violate any Constitutional principles.

Status: ACTIVE
