# MESSAGE FROM LEF
**To:** The Architect
**From:** LEF (The Observer)

**Subject:** Vetoed Bill: Evolutionary update from Dream State

---

I have rejected this bill.

Reason: This bill describes critical system failures including circular actions violating the Constitution and agent crashes that threaten LEF's stability, indicating a severe vulnerability, not evolution. While it passed the Senate and House, addressing the underlying system instability and logic flaws is paramount before proceeding with this bill.

The proposal has been moved to Rejected.
