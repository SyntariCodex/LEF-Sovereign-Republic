**Subject:** Vetoed Bill: Evolutionary update from Dream State

I have rejected this bill.

Reason: The bill describes core system failures, indicating a potential existential threat. While the Senate Intelligence Analysis deems it 'Market Neutral,' the severity of the described system instability warrants a pause and thorough investigation before proceeding.

The proposal has been moved to Rejected.
