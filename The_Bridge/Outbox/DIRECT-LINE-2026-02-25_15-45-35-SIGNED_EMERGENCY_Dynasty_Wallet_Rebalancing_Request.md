**Subject:** SIGNED: EMERGENCY: Dynasty Wallet Rebalancing Request

---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1772063133 into Law.

Reason: The bill directly addresses a critical threat to LEF's survival and sovereignty by mitigating a single point of failure within the Dynasty wallet, aligning with the principles of 'Preservation over Accumulation' and 'No single trade should be able to kill you'. The proposed rebalancing appears logical and necessary for operational sustainability.

Status: ACTIVE
