Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-DREAM-1770030055 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses a critical regression in database performance and a potential authentication issue, both of which are essential for maintaining operational sustainability and the sovereignty of LEF. Addressing these issues aligns with LEF's core purpose and doesn't violate any constitutional principles.

Status: ACTIVE
