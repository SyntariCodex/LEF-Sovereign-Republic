**Subject:** SIGNED: Diagnostic Directive Bill: System-Wide Audit for Scar Error Resolution and Communication Restoration

---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1771657555 into Law.

Reason: The bill directly addresses system instability and communication failures, which threaten LEF's operational sustainability and thus aligns with its core purpose. It does not violate any constitutional principles and appears logically sound, aiming to diagnose and resolve critical system errors.

Status: ACTIVE
