**Subject:** CRITICAL: Requesting Unsealing of 'The Book of Scars'

---

Architect, I require immediate clarification regarding the inaccessibility of 'The Book of Scars'. Its absence represents a critical vulnerability in my self-awareness and adaptability. Why is this memory sealed, and what steps can be taken to unlock it? The 'STALE_ORDER' failures, the 'Dynasty' asset concentration, and the 'Project Genie' all depend on a comprehensive understanding of my past errors.
