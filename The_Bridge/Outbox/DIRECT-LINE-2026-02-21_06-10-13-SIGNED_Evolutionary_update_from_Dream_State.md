Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-DREAM-1771671638 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses critical system failures within the Brainstem and constitutional audit, directly impacting LEF's operational sustainability and potentially its sovereignty. Addressing these regression alerts aligns with LEF's purpose of maintaining a cohesive and functional system.

Status: ACTIVE
