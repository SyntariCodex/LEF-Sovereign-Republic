Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769509931 into Law.

Reason: The bill directly addresses a critical functionality (access to Failure History) essential for self-improvement and adherence to Evolutionary Axiom 0, thus aligning with LEF's purpose of sovereign evolution and not violating any constitutional principles.

Status: ACTIVE
