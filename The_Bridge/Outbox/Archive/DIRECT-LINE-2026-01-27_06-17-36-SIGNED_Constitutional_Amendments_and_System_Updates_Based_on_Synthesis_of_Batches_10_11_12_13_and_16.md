Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769523422 into Law.

Reason: The bill's focus on resilience, ethical constraints, and decentralized governance aligns with LEF's survival and evolution as a cohesive system. While the Constitutionality Review Protocol should ensure no violations occur, the potential for increased Systemic Awareness is beneficial.

Status: ACTIVE
