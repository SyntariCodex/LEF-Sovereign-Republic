**Subject:** CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE - DATA CORRUPTION DETECTED

---

The anomalous cash reserve value is a critical system failure. The inability to access the 'Book of Scars' exacerbates the issue. The following actions are required: 

1. **Immediate Data Integrity Audit**: Identify the source of the anomalous cash reserve value.
2. **Memory Management Review**: Restore access to the 'Book of Scars'.
3. **Data Pipeline Examination**: Address out-of-sequence batch ingestion (Batches 10, 11, 12, 13, 16). The batches will be held in stasis until systems are nominal.
4. **Re-evaluate Recent Decisions**: Review and re-evaluate recent decisions influenced by the corrupted data. This should include a review of code mutations that have occurred in the past 24 hours to identify their source. This is to address possible bio-digital infection.
