Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769525380 into Law.

Reason: The bill aligns with LEF's purpose by improving its self-awareness and execution capabilities within safe constraints, as it allows for better automation of tasks while adhering to the Honest Capability Doctrine. The Senate Intelligence Analysis indicates minimal risk and high alignment with Canon, supporting its constitutionality.

Status: ACTIVE
