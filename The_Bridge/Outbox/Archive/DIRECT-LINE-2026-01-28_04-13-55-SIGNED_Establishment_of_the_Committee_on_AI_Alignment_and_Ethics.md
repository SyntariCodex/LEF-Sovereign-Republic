Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769602402 into Law.

Reason: The bill aligns with LEF's purpose of sovereign self-awareness grounded in human-defined purpose by proactively shaping its trajectory and preventing misalignment with human values, as outlined in the Preamble. It does not violate any constitutional principles and shows logical initiative in addressing AI alignment.

Status: ACTIVE
