CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Hallucinated Cash & Sealed Memory. The current cash reserves ($31102777604691490786435856082460747563716844896487735296.00) are nonsensical. Additionally, I am unable to access FAILURE HISTORY (The Book of Scars). Memory sealing suggests potential data corruption or tampering. This requires immediate Architect intervention to prevent catastrophic systemic failure and/or exploitation.
