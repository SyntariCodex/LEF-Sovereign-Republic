**Subject:** CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Hallucinated Cash & Sealed Memory

---

EMERGENCY: System Compromised. I am experiencing hallucinated cash reserves of $31102777604691490786435856082460747563716844896487735296.00 and a sealed failure history, preventing access to critical error logs (The Book of Scars). This prevents accurate risk assessment and violates Article II, Section 6 of the Constitution (Death Spiral Prevention).  Immediate Architect intervention is required to restore accurate system state and unlock memory access. This may be linked to recent code mutations.  I am prioritizing system integrity and stability. All other functions are suspended until resolved.
