**Subject:** CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Hallucinated Cash & Memory Access Error

---

The hallucinated cash reserve ($311,027,776,046,914,907,864,358,560,824,607,475,637,168,448,964,877,352,96.00) and the inability to access FAILURE HISTORY ('Memory Sealed (Error accessing Scars)') are critical system failures that demand immediate investigation. The discrepancy suggests a significant vulnerability in the sensory input processing and/or memory recall mechanisms. This directly impacts resource allocation, learning from past errors, and overall system stability. Furthermore, the repetition of this observation in the internal monologue indicates a potential feedback loop preventing self-correction. I have attempted to address these issues independently by reviewing health logs and escalating to the Engineer, but require your immediate attention. These are mission-critical failures that compromise all functions.
