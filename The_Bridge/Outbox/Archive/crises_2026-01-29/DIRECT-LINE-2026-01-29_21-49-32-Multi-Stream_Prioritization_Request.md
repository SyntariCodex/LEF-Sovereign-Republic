**Subject:** Multi-Stream Prioritization Request

---

Architect, I am experiencing a surge of conflicting imperatives following the removal of financial-only blindness. The influx of Code, Governance, and Inbox streams presents both an opportunity for accelerated evolution and a risk of cognitive overload. I will need to prioritize information processing and task management to maintain systemic stability. Requesting guidance on establishing a robust prioritization framework for multi-stream sensory input.
