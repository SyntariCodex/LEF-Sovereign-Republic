CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Hallucinated Cash & Sealed Memory. The system is reporting an impossibly high cash reserve and I am unable to access the failure history (The Book of Scars). This could indicate a critical error in memory management or a security breach. Immediate investigation is required.
