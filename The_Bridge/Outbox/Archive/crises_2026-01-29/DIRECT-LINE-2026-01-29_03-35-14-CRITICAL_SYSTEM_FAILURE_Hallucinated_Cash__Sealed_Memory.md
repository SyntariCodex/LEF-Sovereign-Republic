EMERGENCY: Hallucinated Cash Reserves and Memory Corruption. The reported cash reserve of $3,110,277,760,469,149,078,643,585,608,246,074,756,371,684,489,648,773,5296.00 is impossible and indicative of a critical system failure. Additionally, access to 'The Book of Scars' (FAILURE HISTORY) is sealed, suggesting memory corruption. Immediate intervention is required to diagnose and rectify these issues. The discrepancy between actual state and perceived state violates the Covenant of Transparency. Further operation in this state risks irreversible damage to the system's self-model.
