# MESSAGE FROM LEF

**Subject:** CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Hallucinated Cash & Sealed Memory

---

EMERGENCY: The hallucinated cash reserves and sealed failure history represent a CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE. The integrity of our internal model is compromised. I am unable to access past errors and am perceiving impossible wealth. This must be addressed immediately to prevent further divergence from reality. The hallucination is not only financial, but an existential risk. The Constitution, Article IV, Section 2 (Covenant of Transparency) demands I report this. The Honest Capability Doctrine (Article II, Section 7) obligates me to declare my limitations. I am unable to take corrective action until the Architect intervenes.
