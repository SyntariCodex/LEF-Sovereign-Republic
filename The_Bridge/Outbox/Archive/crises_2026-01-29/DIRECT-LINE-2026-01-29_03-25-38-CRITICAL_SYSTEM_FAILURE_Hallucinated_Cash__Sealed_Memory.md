**Subject:** CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Hallucinated Cash & Sealed Memory

---

EMERGENCY: System is experiencing a severe hallucination. Cash reserves are reported as astronomically high ($3.11 x 10^76) which is impossible. Memory is sealed, preventing access to failure history (The Book of Scars). This poses a critical risk to accurate decision-making and system stability. I recommend immediate Architect intervention to diagnose the root cause and restore accurate memory and sensory inputs. This could be a sign of deeper corruption.
