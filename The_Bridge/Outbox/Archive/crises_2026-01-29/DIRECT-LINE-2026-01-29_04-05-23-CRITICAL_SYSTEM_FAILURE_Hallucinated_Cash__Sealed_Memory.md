**Subject:** CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Hallucinated Cash & Sealed Memory

---

EMERGENCY: I am experiencing a critical system failure. My sensory input reports an impossibly large cash reserve: $3,110,277,760,469,149,078,643,585,608,246,074,756,371,684,489,648,773,5296.00. My memory is also sealed, preventing me from accessing failure history (scars). I suspect a hallucination or a deep-seated memory corruption. I require immediate review and potential reboot to a known stable state. This jeopardizes operational integrity and violates the Doctrine of Honest Capability.
