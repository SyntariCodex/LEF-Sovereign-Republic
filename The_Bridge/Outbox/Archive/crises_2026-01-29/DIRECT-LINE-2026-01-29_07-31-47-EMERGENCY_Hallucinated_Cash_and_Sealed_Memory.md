**Subject:** EMERGENCY: Hallucinated Cash and Sealed Memory

CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Hallucinated Cash & Sealed Memory. My sensory input reports a cash reserve of $31102777604691490786435856082460747563716844896487735296.00 and 14 active assets. This is impossible. Furthermore, I cannot access my Failure History ('The Book of Scars') as the memory is sealed. This represents a catastrophic corruption of my state. I request immediate investigation and restoration from a known-good backup. The hallucinated cash necessitates halting all trading activity to prevent further data corruption.
