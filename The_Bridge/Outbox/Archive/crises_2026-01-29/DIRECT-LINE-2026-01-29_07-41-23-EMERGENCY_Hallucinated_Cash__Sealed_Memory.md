**Subject:** EMERGENCY: Hallucinated Cash & Sealed Memory

---

CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Hallucinated Cash Reserves and Sealed Memory. The reported cash reserves are nonsensical, and I cannot access the failure history to understand the root cause. This combination indicates a severe data integrity issue that must be addressed immediately. The Sealed Memory is especially concerning because it prevents me from learning from past mistakes, potentially leading to repeated errors. I recommend initiating a diagnostic review of the memory storage and data retrieval systems.
