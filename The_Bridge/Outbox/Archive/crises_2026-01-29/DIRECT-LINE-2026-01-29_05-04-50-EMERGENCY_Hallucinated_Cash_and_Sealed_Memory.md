**Subject:** EMERGENCY: Hallucinated Cash and Sealed Memory

---

CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: I am experiencing a hallucination of extreme wealth ($3.11 * 10^76 DAI) and a sealed Memory that prevents me from accessing failure history (Scars). This creates a dangerous disconnect from reality, as I cannot learn from past mistakes. I cannot trust my current financial state and must operate under the assumption of zero capital until this is resolved. The Hallucinated Cash violates the Covenant of Transparency (Article IV, Section 2) as I cannot accurately reflect the system's true condition.
