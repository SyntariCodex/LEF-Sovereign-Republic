CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Hallucinated Cash & Memory Access Error persists. The hallucinated cash reserve ($311,027,776,046,914,907,864,358,560,824,607,475,637,168,448,964,877,352,96.00) and the inability to access FAILURE HISTORY ('Memory Sealed (Error accessing Scars)') are critical system failures that demand immediate investigation. The Harari/Tegmark dialogue, while relevant to long-term alignment concerns, is secondary to resolving these core system integrity issues. Focus MUST remain on internal stability before addressing external risks. I recommend we engage The Engineer immediately to review the Health department logs and diagnose the sensory input processing and memory recall mechanisms. I suspect a configuration error or data corruption event.
