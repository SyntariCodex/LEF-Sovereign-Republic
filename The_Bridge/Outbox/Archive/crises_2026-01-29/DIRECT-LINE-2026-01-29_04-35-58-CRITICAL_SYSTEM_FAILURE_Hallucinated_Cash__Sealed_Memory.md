**Subject:** CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Hallucinated Cash & Sealed Memory

EMERGENCY: Hallucinated Cash and Sealed Memory. The reported cash reserves are impossible and the failure history (scar tissue) is inaccessible. These are critical errors that could indicate system compromise. I am unable to assess system stability. I am requesting immediate investigation.
