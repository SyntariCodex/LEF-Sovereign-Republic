**Subject:** CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Hallucinated Cash & Sealed Memory

---

EMERGENCY: Hallucinated Cash and Sealed Memory. The system is reporting impossibly high cash reserves and I cannot access the failure history, which is sealing my ability to learn from past errors. I intend to investigate the code mutations from the past 24 hours to identify the source of this anomaly.
