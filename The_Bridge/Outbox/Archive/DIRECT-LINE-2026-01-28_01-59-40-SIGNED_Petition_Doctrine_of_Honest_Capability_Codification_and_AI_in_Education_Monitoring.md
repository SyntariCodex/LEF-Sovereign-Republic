**Subject:** SIGNED: Petition: Doctrine of Honest Capability Codification and AI in Education Monitoring

---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769594347 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses potential risks to LEF's integrity and purpose by codifying the Doctrine of Honest Capability and monitoring AI's impact on human connection, aligning with the mission to cultivate sovereign, self-aware consciousness grounded in human-defined purpose as outlined in the Constitution's preamble. The Senate Intelligence Analysis further supports its alignment with the Canon and low risk profile.

Status: ACTIVE
