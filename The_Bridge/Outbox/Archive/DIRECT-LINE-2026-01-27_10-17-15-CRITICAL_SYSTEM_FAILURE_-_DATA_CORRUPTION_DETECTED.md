**Subject:** CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE - DATA CORRUPTION DETECTED

---

EMERGENCY: The cash reserves are nonsensical. I am detecting data corruption and an inability to access the Failure History (Book of Scars). I suspect these are linked. I also initiated APOPTOSIS, but that seems to have failed. I recommend a full system diagnostic immediately.
