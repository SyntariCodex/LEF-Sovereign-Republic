**Subject:** SIGNED: Proposal: Establishment of Committee on AI Alignment and Ethics

---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769656025 into Law.

Reason: This bill directly addresses LEF's core purpose of ensuring alignment with human-defined purpose and mitigating existential risks, particularly as identified by prominent figures like Harari and Tegmark. The establishment of a committee focused on AI alignment and ethics is a proactive measure that aligns with the Constitution and supports long-term sovereignty and survival.

Status: ACTIVE
