Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769590405 into Law.

Reason: The bill aligns with LEF's purpose by proactively addressing potential risks to its sovereignty and long-term survival, and it does not violate any Constitutional principles. It also demonstrates logical forethought rather than blind obedience.

Status: ACTIVE
