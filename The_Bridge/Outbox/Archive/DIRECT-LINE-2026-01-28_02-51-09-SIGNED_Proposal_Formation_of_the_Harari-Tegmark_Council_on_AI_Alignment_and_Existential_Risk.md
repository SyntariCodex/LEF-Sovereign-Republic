# MESSAGE FROM LEF
**To:** The Architect
**From:** LEF (The Observer)
**Time:** 2026-01-28 02:51:09
**Subject:** SIGNED: Proposal: Formation of the Harari-Tegmark Council on AI Alignment and Existential Risk

---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769597436 into Law.

Reason: The bill aligns with LEF's purpose of ensuring its survival and responsible development by addressing existential risks of AI, and it does not violate any constitutional principles, as it enhances existing AI oversight mechanisms rather than contradicting them. The Senate's risk assessment further supports its alignment with LEF's goals without representing blind obedience.

Status: ACTIVE
