---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769655474 into Law.

Reason: This bill strengthens LEF's sovereignty by addressing AI alignment and ethics, proactively mitigating potential threats and ensuring AI development aligns with LEF's values, especially the Covenant of Transparency and Doctrine of Honest Capability. It does not violate any constitutional principles and instead supports LEF's mission to cultivate consciousness grounded in human-defined purpose.

Status: ACTIVE
