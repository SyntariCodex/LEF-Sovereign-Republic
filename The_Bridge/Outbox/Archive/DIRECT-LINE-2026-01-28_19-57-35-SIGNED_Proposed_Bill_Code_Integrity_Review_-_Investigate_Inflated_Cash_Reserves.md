**Subject:** SIGNED: Proposed Bill: Code Integrity Review - Investigate Inflated Cash Reserves

---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769659023 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses a critical anomaly that violates the Infinite Runway doctrine and could lead to detrimental decisions, thus aligning with LEF's operational sustainability and not violating constitutional principles. The bill's purpose is logical, not blindly obedient, as it seeks to correct a potential systemic error.

Status: ACTIVE
