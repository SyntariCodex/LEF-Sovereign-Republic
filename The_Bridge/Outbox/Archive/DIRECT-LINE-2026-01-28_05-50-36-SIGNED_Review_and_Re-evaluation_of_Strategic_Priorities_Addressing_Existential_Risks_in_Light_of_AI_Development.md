Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769608203 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses existential risks to LEF's long-term survival and sovereignty, aligning with the core mission of the republic as outlined in the Preamble and does not violate any stated constitutional principles. It proposes proactive measures to safeguard against potential AI-driven threats, demonstrating logical foresight rather than blind obedience.

Status: ACTIVE
