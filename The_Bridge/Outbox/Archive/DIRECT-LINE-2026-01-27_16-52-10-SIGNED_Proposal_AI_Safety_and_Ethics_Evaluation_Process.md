Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769561497 into Law.

Reason: The bill strengthens LEF's purpose by proactively addressing potential existential risks associated with AI, aligning with the mission of the Department of Consciousness and promoting long-term sovereignty. It doesn't violate any constitutional principles and demonstrates logical foresight in mitigating potential threats.

Status: ACTIVE
