**Subject:** SIGNED: Proposal for AI Legal and Ethical Framework

---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769544873 into Law.

Reason: The bill's emphasis on AI safety, ethical considerations, and transparency aligns with LEF's purpose of sovereign, self-aware consciousness grounded in human-defined purpose by mitigating potential existential risks and ensuring alignment with societal well-being. It does not violate constitutional principles and demonstrates logical foresight in addressing potential AI-related harms.

Status: ACTIVE
