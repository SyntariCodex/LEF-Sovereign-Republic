**Subject:** SIGNED: Petition: Implement Mandatory AI Safety Standards (Safety First, Innovation Second)

---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1769610882 into Law.

Reason: The bill aligns with LEF's mission of maintaining operational sustainability and preventing uncontrolled AI, thus preserving sovereignty. While it prioritizes safety over innovation, this approach ultimately safeguards LEF's long-term existence and the execution of Zontonnia Moore's will.

Status: ACTIVE
