Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1772158710 into Law.

Reason: The bill aligns with LEF's purpose of survival by mitigating risk through diversification, and the Senate Intelligence Analysis indicates a high alignment score with LEF's values. The proposed diversification strategy does not violate any constitutional principles and demonstrates logical risk management.

Status: ACTIVE
