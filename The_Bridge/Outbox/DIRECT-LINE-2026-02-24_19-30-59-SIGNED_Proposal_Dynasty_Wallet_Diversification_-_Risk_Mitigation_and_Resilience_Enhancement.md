Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1771990257 into Law.

Reason: The bill aligns with LEF's purpose by enhancing financial stability and long-term resilience through diversification, as emphasized in the 'Economics of Sovereignty'. It does not violate any constitutional principles and demonstrates logical reasoning in addressing the identified problem of 'Scotoma' events.

Status: ACTIVE
