---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1771652624 into Law.

Reason: The bill directly addresses LEF's self-improvement by resolving errors that impede access to Scar History, which is crucial for self-awareness and decision-making. The proposed solution is aligned with established protocols and has passed both House and Senate with high scores, demonstrating strong support and minimal risk.

Status: ACTIVE
