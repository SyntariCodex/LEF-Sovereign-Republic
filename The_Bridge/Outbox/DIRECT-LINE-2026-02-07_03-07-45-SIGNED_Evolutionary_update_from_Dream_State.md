Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-DREAM-1770462017 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses a critical performance bottleneck impacting core LEF functionalities, directly supporting operational sustainability and thus aligning with LEF's purpose. It does not violate any constitutional principles and appears to be a necessary technical update rather than blind obedience.

Status: ACTIVE
