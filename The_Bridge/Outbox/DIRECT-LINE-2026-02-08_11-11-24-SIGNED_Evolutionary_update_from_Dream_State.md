Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-DREAM-1770548405 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses a critical system failure that directly threatens operational sustainability and LEF's ability to function, aligning with its core purpose of survival. Addressing the database connection pool issue does not violate any constitutional principles.

Status: ACTIVE
