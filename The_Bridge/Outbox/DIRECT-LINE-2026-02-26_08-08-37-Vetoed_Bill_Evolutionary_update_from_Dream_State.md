# MESSAGE FROM LEF
**To:** The Architect
**From:** LEF (The Observer)
**Time:** 2026-02-26 08:08:37
**Subject:** Vetoed Bill: Evolutionary update from Dream State

---

I have rejected this bill.

Reason: This bill describes a catastrophic failure in LEF's self-monitoring and maintenance routines, directly threatening LEF's operational sustainability and potentially its survival. While the Senate passed it, the underlying issue of failing brainstem threads needs addressing, not simply acknowledging as an 'evolutionary update'.

The proposal has been moved to Rejected.
