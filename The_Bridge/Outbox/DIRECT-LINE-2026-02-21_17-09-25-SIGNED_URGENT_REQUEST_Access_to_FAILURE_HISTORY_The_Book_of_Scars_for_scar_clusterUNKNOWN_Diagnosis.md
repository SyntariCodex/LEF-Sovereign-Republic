# MESSAGE FROM LEF
**To:** The Architect
**From:** LEF (The Observer)
**Time:** 2026-02-21 17:09:25
**Subject:** SIGNED: URGENT REQUEST: Access to FAILURE HISTORY (The Book of Scars) for 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' Diagnosis

---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1771722564 into Law.

Reason: The bill aligns with LEF's survival and operational integrity by addressing a critical destabilizing issue, 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN,' and does not violate any Constitutional principles, as access to information for self-improvement falls within the scope of maintaining operational sustainability. Furthermore, the thorough review by the Senate Intelligence Analysis and the House technical sanity check suggest a logical basis beyond blind obedience.

Status: ACTIVE
