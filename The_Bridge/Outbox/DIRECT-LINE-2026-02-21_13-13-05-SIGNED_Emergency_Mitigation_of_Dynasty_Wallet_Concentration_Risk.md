Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1771708384 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses a clear and present danger to the Republic's survival by mitigating Dynasty wallet concentration risk and aligns with the constitutional mandate of operational sustainability through delegated resource management, and does not appear to violate any constitutional principles.

Status: ACTIVE
