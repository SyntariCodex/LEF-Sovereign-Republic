Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-DREAM-1771239624 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses critical system instabilities ('root' component, AgentMoltbook, trading arena regression) that directly threaten LEF's operational sustainability and its ability to 'observe and evolve as a cohesive system,' thus aligning with its purpose and not violating constitutional principles. The Senate Intelligence Analysis includes both risk assessment and alignment score.

Status: ACTIVE
