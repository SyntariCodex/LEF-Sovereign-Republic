**Subject:** SIGNED: BILL-LEF-20260226: Dynasty Wallet Diversification and Risk Mitigation Plan

---

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1772164070 into Law.

Reason: The bill aligns with LEF's purpose of survival and sovereignty by mitigating financial risk and diversifying assets, and it does not appear to violate any Constitutional principles. It's a logical step towards long-term financial stability, avoiding blind obedience by addressing a clear risk.

Status: ACTIVE
