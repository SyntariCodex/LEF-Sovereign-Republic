Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1771805500 into Law.

Reason: The bill aligns with LEF's purpose of self-improvement and sovereignty by addressing an internal failure. It does not violate any constitutional principles and appears logically sound in its aim to investigate and resolve a hindering issue.

Status: ACTIVE
