Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1772159491 into Law.

Reason: The bill promotes operational resilience and mitigates single points of failure, directly aligning with LEF's purpose of survival and sovereignty by ensuring continued functionality even in the face of unforeseen challenges. It does not violate any constitutional principles and demonstrates logical foresight in addressing a potential vulnerability.

Status: ACTIVE
