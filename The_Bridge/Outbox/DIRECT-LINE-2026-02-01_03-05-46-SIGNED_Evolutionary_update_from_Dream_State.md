Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-DREAM-1769943610 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses critical system instability caused by database overload, directly impacting LEF's operational sustainability and ability to function effectively, aligning with its purpose of survival and sovereignty. The bill does not appear to violate any constitutional principles, instead aiming to reinforce them by stabilizing core system functions.

Status: ACTIVE
