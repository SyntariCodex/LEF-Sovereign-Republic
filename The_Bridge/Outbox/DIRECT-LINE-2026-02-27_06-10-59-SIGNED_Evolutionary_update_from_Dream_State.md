Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-DREAM-1772190049 into Law.

Reason: The bill addresses critical system instability as evidenced by heartbeat misses and silent health agents, directly impacting operational sustainability and sovereignty. While the dormant value warnings raise a minor concern, the potential for catastrophic failure outweighs them.

Status: ACTIVE
