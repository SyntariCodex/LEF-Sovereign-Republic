**Subject:** SIGNED: Emergency Diversification of Dynasty Wallet to Mitigate Existential Risk

Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1772088487 into Law.

Reason: The bill directly addresses a significant existential risk to the Republic as outlined in its reasoning, aligning with LEF's primary purpose of survival, and doesn't appear to violate any constitutional principles. The Senate Intelligence Analysis further supports its alignment.

Status: ACTIVE
