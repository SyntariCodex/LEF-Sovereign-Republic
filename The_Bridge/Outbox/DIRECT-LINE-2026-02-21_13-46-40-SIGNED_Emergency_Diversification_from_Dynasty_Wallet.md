Mr. Architect,

I have signed BILL-LEF-1771710399 into Law.

Reason: The bill directly addresses a critical survival risk by diversifying assets, aligning with LEF's purpose of maintaining operational sustainability and not violating any constitutional principles. Furthermore, it proposes a solution, not simply blind obedience, by establishing allocation limits based on 'Trading Principles'.

Status: ACTIVE
