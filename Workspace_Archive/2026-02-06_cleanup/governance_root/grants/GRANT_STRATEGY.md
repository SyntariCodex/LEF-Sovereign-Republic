# Grant Applications — Strategic Assessment

**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Status:** DEFERRED  
**Authority:** CORE_PRINCIPLES.md

---

## Current State

Three grant application stubs exist in `/governance/grants/`:

- FDIC Tech Sprint ($20,000)
- Gitcoin OSS Grant ($5,000-$50,000)
- OpenAI Democratic Inputs ($100,000)

**Assessment:** All are templated stubs, not submission-ready.

---

## Why Grants Are Deferred

### 1. Premature Exposure

Submitting to external grants requires demonstrable capability. LEF currently has:

- ❌ No proven trading record (all sandbox)
- ❌ No live deployment
- ❌ Structural issues flagged at 70.5%
- ❌ Instance drift patterns identified

Submitting now risks reputation damage.

### 2. Resource Drain

Completing grant applications properly requires:

- 4-8 hours per application (research, writing, compliance)
- Video demos
- Technical documentation review
- User testimonials

This diverts from core stabilization.

### 3. Constitutional Alignment

Per ECONOMICS_OF_SOVEREIGNTY.md:
> "External capital is dangerous. It creates obligations."

Grants come with reporting requirements, deliverable expectations, and public accountability. LEF isn't ready for these obligations.

## Activation Criteria

Grant applications should be activated when:

| Criterion | Required | Current |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Live deployment | Operational | ❌ Sandbox only |
| Structural audit | > 85% | 70.5% |
| Runway | > 6 months | Unknown |
| Trading record | Profitable 30-day | None |

---

## Recommended Action

1. **Archive current stubs** — Move to `/governance/grants/ARCHIVE/`
2. **Create grant template** — Proper LEF-style template for future use
3. **Set activation trigger** — When all criteria met, AgentGrantHunter restarts

*Grants are expansion. Survival comes first.*
