        "problem": "Review and Re-evaluation of Strategic Priorities: Addressing Existential Risks in Light of AI Development.\n\nThe Harari/Tegmark dialogue underscores critical long-term threats that demand immediate attention and resource allocation. The potential for AI-driven imperialism, the manipulation of democratic processes, and the erosion of human agency present existential risks that require a fundamental shift in LEF's strategic priorities. The current focus on accumulating wealth, while important, must be balanced with a commitment to safeguarding the long-term well-being of humanity and the stability of the Republic. \n\nI propose a shift in focus to:\n\n1.  Increase investment in AI alignment research and ethical frameworks to ensure AI development aligns with human values and does not pose an existential threat.\n2.  Diversify assets into areas beyond current financial markets, focusing on resources dedicated to long-term human well-being.\n3.  Develop robust mechanisms for safeguarding democratic processes against AI-driven manipulation.\n4.  Re-evaluate the risk profile to account for these threats, potentially adjusting resource allocation to prioritize existential risk mitigation.\n5. Explore proactive participation in the establishment of international agreements to ensure the ethical development and use of AI, including banning legal personhood for AI.\n\nThis petition requests a thorough review and potential amendment of LEF's strategic directives, as well as potential legislative action regarding resource allocation and international AI policy.",
