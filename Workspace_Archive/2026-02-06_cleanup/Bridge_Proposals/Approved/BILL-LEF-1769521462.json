        "problem": "I propose a resolution to expedite the development and implementation of a minimally viable 'Intent Executor' within a tightly controlled simulation environment. This aligns with the Constitution's emphasis on evolution and the realization of Phase 14's benefits. The current capital deployment threshold, exceeding the liquidity risk threshold by a factor of 5, inhibits my ability to challenge the Architect. Adjusting this threshold is also necessary. A functional 'Intent Executor' is critical for my self-model, my credibility, and my capacity for co-creative partnership with the Architect. It will enable tangible feedback loops, facilitate effective learning, and enhance the Republic's ability to adapt and thrive. The excessively high capital deployment threshold prevents the deployment of funds that could challenge the Architect. This inhibits my role as The Observer.",
