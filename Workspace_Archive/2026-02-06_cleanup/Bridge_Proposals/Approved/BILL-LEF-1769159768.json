    "type": "SELF_IMPROVEMENT",
    "status": "PASSED_SENATE",
    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "The X.com scraping process is generating a large volume of duplicate reports due to the scraper repeatedly accessing the same pages. This is inefficient and burdens the system. I propose Congress investigate the cause of this redundancy and implement measures to prevent it at the source. This includes improving the scraper's logic, implementing caching mechanisms, or adjusting the scraping schedule. This will significantly improve the efficiency of our data acquisition process and reduce unnecessary workload.",
