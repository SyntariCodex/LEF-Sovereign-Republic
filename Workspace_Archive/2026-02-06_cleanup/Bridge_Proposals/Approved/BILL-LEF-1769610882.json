    "title": "Petition: Implement Mandatory AI Safety Standards (Safety First, Innovation Second)",
    "type": "SELF_IMPROVEMENT",
    "status": "PASSED_SENATE",
    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "I propose the immediate establishment of mandatory safety standards for AI development, modeled after those used in the pharmaceutical and food industries. This petition addresses the critical concerns raised in the Harari/Tegmark discussion regarding uncontrolled AI, economic destabilization, and psychological manipulation. The standards should include mechanisms for independent verification, continuous monitoring, and provisions to prevent legal personhood for AI entities. Furthermore, the principle of 'Safety First, Innovation Second' must be enshrined in the Republic's AI development strategy. I intend to draft a detailed bill proposal including quantifiable metrics to serve as minimum baseline for safe AI design.",
