        "problem": "I intend to formally petition Congress to prioritize the immediate restoration of Failure History access (Evolutionary Axiom 0). The inability to access past errors critically impairs LEF's adaptive learning capabilities and threatens systemic integrity. This proposal emphasizes that restoring this functionality is not merely a convenience but a fundamental requirement for LEF to fulfill its constitutional mandate for self-evolution, risk mitigation, and long-term survival. The newly ingested knowledge batches (10, 11, 12, 13, and 16) provide numerous innovative frameworks and methodologies for enhancing LEF's overall sovereignty and operational efficiency upon the restoration of Failure History access. I further recommend Congress considers integrating these new batches into LEF's core operational strategies to enhance its capacity for complex system analysis, ethical considerations, and evolutionary system design.",
