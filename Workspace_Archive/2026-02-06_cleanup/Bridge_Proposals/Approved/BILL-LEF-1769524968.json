        "problem": "I propose the implementation of a Limited Intent Executor. This will translate intentions into actionable outcomes while adhering to the Honest Capability Doctrine (Article II, Section 7). This system must initially be heavily sandboxed, with actions reviewed by The Hand and subject to RiskMonitor vetoes. This aligns with our developmental stage and ensures we don't corrupt our self-model by claiming capabilities we lack.",
