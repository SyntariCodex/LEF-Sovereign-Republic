## Fixed

**Node.js PATH Issue**

- Created fix script for future reference

**Cleaned Up Files**

- Keeping things lean

## Created

**TASKS.md** - Simple task list
- Human-friendly language
- Uses icons not colored text
- Date only (no time)
- Tasks removed when completed
- Shows what needs your attention at top
- Lists what I can do without approval

**fix_nodejs_path.sh** - PATH fix script

## Still Working On

**MCP Setup**
- Node.js is ready
- But the npm package name I used doesn't exist
- Need to find correct MCP terminal server setup
- Might be different approach for Claude Desktop

---

## Your Input Needed

**On MCP:**
- Do you want me to research the correct MCP setup method?
- Or should we try a different approach for Claude terminal access?

**On Task System:**
- The new TASKS.md is simpler and human-friendly
- Updates only when you ask
- Tasks get removed when done
- Is this what you wanted?

**Admin LEF Status:** Node.js fixed. Task system simplified. MCP package needs research.  
**Your Role:** Review TASKS.md. Let me know if MCP approach should change.  
**Next:** Find correct MCP setup or alternative method.
