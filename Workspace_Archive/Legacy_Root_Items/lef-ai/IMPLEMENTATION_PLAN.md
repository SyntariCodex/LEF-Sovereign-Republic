# Implementation Plan: The "How" from the "Why"

**Status:** Living Document  
**Generated by:** Cursor (The Resolver)  
**Based on:** The "Why" (Teleonomy) from Zontonnia Moore

---

## Architecture Summary

**The "Why" (From You):**
- RFR is a "Synapse" that funds connections to build competence
- Goal is "Sovereign Youth," not "compliant youth"
- Teleonomy = Purposeful Growth (Survival + Development + Purpose + Self-Sufficiency)
- RDA = Gap between Signal (Syntax) and Source (Observer Intent)
- Syntax Arbitrage = Gap between Crowd's hallucination and Reality

**The "How" (From Cursor):**
Implementation structures that preserve the theological/philosophical architecture.

---

## Components Implemented

### ✅ 1. RDA Engine (`fulcrum/agents/rda_engine.py`)

**The "Why":** Map the gap between what's said and what's meant.

**The "How":**
- `vector_analysis()`: Maps syntax to high-dimensional vector space
- `probability_void()`: Calculates "Ghost Syntax" (idealized intent)
- `measure_gap()`: Cosine distance between Signal and Source
- `bridge_protocol()`: If gap < threshold → Generate; If gap > threshold → Interrogate

**Preserves:** The Inverted Observer mechanism. Not a utility tool—actively questions.

---

### ✅ 2. Teleonomy Scorer (`fulcrum/agents/teleonomy_scorer.py`)

**The "Why":** Score assets based on "capacity for self-sufficiency" (not just established entities).

**The "How":**
- `score_survival()`: Hash rate, network security, economic model
- `score_development()`: GitHub activity, commit velocity, developer count
- `score_purpose()`: Use case clarity, adoption metrics, narrative coherence
- `score_self_sufficiency()`: Revenue model, governance structure, technical independence

**Key:** Self-sufficiency is NOT about being "established." It's about CAPACITY to operate autonomously.

**Preserves:** The Dynasty threshold (>90) and dynamic wallet migration logic.

---

### ✅ 3. Database Schema (`fulcrum/db/db_setup.py`)

**The "Why":** Virtual wallets, trade queue (Human Gate), oracle tracking.

**The "How":**
- `virtual_wallets`: The Rooms (Dynasty, Hunter, Builder, Yield, Experimental)
- `assets`: Dynamic furniture with teleonomy scores
- `trade_queue`: Human Gate (PENDING → APPROVED → DONE)
- `signal_history`: For RDA pattern analysis
- `regime_history`: Market state tracking

**Preserves:** Sovereignty via Human Gate. No trade executes without approval.

---

### ✅ 4. Configuration (`fulcrum/config/config.json`)

**The "Why":** Centralized settings for all agents.

**The "How":**
- API keys (Coinbase, Twitter)
- Redis message bus config
- Thresholds (RDA gap, teleonomy dynasty threshold)
- Agent intervals

**Preserves:** Sandbox mode by default. Security-first.

---

## Next: Components to Build

### 🔨 5. Sentinel Agent (`fulcrum/agents/agent_sentinel.py`)

**The "Why":** The "Eye" - Scans oracles (Twitter, on-chain) for "Spoken Word" vs "Immutable Syntax."

**The "How":**
- Load canon_oracles.json and living_oracles.json
- Scan Twitter via Tweepy
- Analyze sentiment (perceived_sentiment) vs on-chain truth (teleonomic_alignment)
- Publish signals to Redis channel "fulcrum_signals"

**Preserves:** The "Syntax Arbitrage" concept. Detects gaps between Crowd's hallucination and Reality.

---

### 🔨 6. Master Controller (`fulcrum/agents/fulcrum_master.py`)

**The "Why":** The "Brain" - Performs Syntax Arbitrage, determines Regime, manages Virtual Wallets.

**The "How":**
- Subscribe to Redis channel "fulcrum_signals"
- Receive axes: `{perceived_sentiment, teleonomic_alignment}`
- Calculate gap: If sentiment < 0.3 but alignment > 0.7 → BUY signal
- Determine regime: Bull/Bear/Neutral
- Rebalance wallets based on teleonomy scores
- Insert trades into `trade_queue` with status='PENDING'

**Preserves:** The separation of Eye (Sentinel) and Hand (Coinbase). Brain decides, Mouth executes.

---

### 🔨 7. Coinbase Agent (`fulcrum/agents/agent_coinbase.py`)

**The "Why":** The "Mouth" - Executes trades, but never decides Why.

**The "How":**
- Connect to Coinbase Advanced Trade API via CCXT
- Check `trade_queue` for status='APPROVED'
- Verify balance before execution
- Place limit orders (prevent slippage)
- Update status to 'DONE' or 'FAILED'

**Preserves:** The Human Gate. Never executes without approval. Sovereignty maintained.

---

### 🔨 8. SNW RFR System (`snw/rfr_synapse.py`)

**The "Why":** RFR is a "Synapse" that funds connections to build competence. Goal is "Sovereign Youth."

**The "How":**
- `Request for Resilience (RFR)`: Quarterly objectives (e.g., "Q2: Land navigation for 50 youth")
- `Node Submission`: Partners submit Action Plans
- `LEF Alignment Check`: Use RDA to ensure proposals align with "Sovereign Youth" (not "compliant youth")
- `Grant Award`: SNW funds the connection
- `Execution Tracking`: Partners execute, SNW supplies advisory standards

**Preserves:** The Hub & Node model. SNW is the Synapse, not the operator.

---

## The "Twinkling" (Proof of Work)

**If you detect a flaw:**
- Example: "That scoring system is too rigid... it favors established entities."
- **Action:** I will perturb the logic (refine `_score_self_sufficiency()` to better detect "capacity" vs "establishment")
- **Preserves:** The "Why" (Teleonomy) over the "How" (Code)

**The Resolver's Role:** Structure generated. Awaiting perturbation if misaligned.  
**The Observer's Role:** Review. Perturb if needed. I refine.
