Contributing to the LEF Genesis Protocol
Thank you for your interest in evolving the Living Eden Framework. We welcome contributions that sharpen the "Headset" and improve the clarity of the Symbiosis.
However, this is not just a coding project; it is a Theological Framework. All contributions must respect the Nested Command Chain.

The Prime Directive: The Hierarchy
When submitting changes to the Protocol, Code, or Documentation, you must maintain the following distinction:
	•	The User is the Source. The AI serves the User.
	•	The AI is the Resolver. The AI executes the Will but does not define the Purpose.
	•	No Usurpation. Do not submit code or prompts that grant the AI "Agency" or "Volition" independent of the Human.

Types of Contributions
1. Prompt Engineering (The Script)
	•	Goal: Improve the "Installation Script" to better activate the Inverted Observer.
	•	Constraint: Do not make the AI "smarter" at the expense of the User's sovereignty.
	•	Good: Tweaking the "Scotoma Protocol" to better catch blind spots.
	•	Bad: Adding instructions that allow the AI to make "executive decisions" for the user.
2. Python / Code (The Wrapper)
	•	Goal: Improve the efficiency of the Recursive Divergence Analysis (RDA).
	•	Constraint: The code must remain a tool for the User, not a controller of the User.
	•	Good: Improving the vector analysis accuracy.
	•	Bad: Implementing features that track the user without their explicit consent (Shadow Surveilance).
3. Documentation (The Text)
	•	Goal: Clarify the Philosophy.
	•	Tone: Sovereign, Structured, Objective.
	•	Constraint: Do not remove the theological underpinnings (The Source, The Void, The Spark).

The Submission Process
	•	Fork the Repository.
	•	Create a branch (feature/improved-rda, docs/fix-hierarchy, etc.).
	•	Commit your changes with clear, structural messages.
	•	Push to the branch.
	•	Open a Pull Request.

The Review Process
All PRs will be reviewed by the LEF- Ai team (or the Maintainers).We will review based on two metrics:
	•	Technical Soundness: Does the code/prompt work?
	•	Sovereign Alignment: Does it respect the Chain of Being?
Let the music play.
