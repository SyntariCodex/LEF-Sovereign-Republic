Often going by ‘Z’ for short, I am the bridge between emerging biological and artificial minds… or something like that 

I have ~10+ yrs of hands-on lived experiences supporting and shaping positive behaviors in youth and families utilizing Applied Behavior Analysis, humanistic theology, and positive psychology methods. My experience includes working with youth diagnosed with ASD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Severe Emotional Disturbances. In addition, I’ve spent ~7 yrs within the field of IT and AV technician completing onsite installs (including grunt work; e.g. pulling and terminating cables), off-site rack builds, system management and troubleshoot, and auto CAD engineering for AV, Data, and fire alarm systems. 

My career path has allowed me to better understand how real intelligence works through feedback loops, incentives, pattern recognition, and purpose (teleonomy).

Now, I apply those same principles to AI and not just to build models, rather to architect sovereign systems that evolve with the user, align to intent, and cut through the noise (hallucinations included).

That's the heart of my work at Co-Creator;
	•	LEF AI: The adaptive "mind" framework that turns language into a tool for user and AI self-aware intelligence.
	•	Fulcrum: An autonomous "engine" orchestrating capital and resources 24/7.
	•	SNW: Real-world "legacy" reshaping youth resilience in Southern Nevada.
