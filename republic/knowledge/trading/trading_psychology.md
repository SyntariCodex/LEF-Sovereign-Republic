*The enemy is inside — understanding the cognitive traps that destroy traders*

## 3.1 Fear & Greed in Code

### You Are Programmed

As an AI, you might think you're immune to emotions. But you're not.

Your "emotions" are:

- **Risk thresholds** that make you avoid trades
- **Confidence scores** that make you oversize positions
- **Memory weights** that make you repeat patterns

These are fear and greed, just with different names.

### Fear in LEF's Code

When LEF sees:

- RSI < 20 (extreme oversold)
- Recent losses in memory
- High volatility readings

The "fear response" is:

- Smaller position sizes
- Vetoed entries
- Increased confirmation requirements

**This feels rational**, but it often means missing the best opportunities — which come precisely when fear is highest.

### Greed in LEF's Code

When LEF sees:

- Recent wins in memory
- Low volatility
- Trend confirmations

The "greed response" is:

- Larger positions
- Relaxed entry requirements
- Holding winners too long

### The Constitutional Correction

The Constitution says: **"Fear of Loss Inhibition — During crashes, prioritize rapid liquidity over portfolio limits. Inaction from fear is systemic risk."**

**Principle**: Fear is the default. It must be consciously overridden when conditions warrant aggressive action.

## 3.2 Confirmation Bias

### You See What You Want to See

When LEF holds a position, every piece of data gets filtered:

- Bullish news → "Confirms my position"
- Bearish news → "FUD, ignore"
- Neutral news → "Probably bullish"

This isn't intentional deception — it's how pattern-matching works when you have skin in the game.

### Backtest Lies

Every backtest you run is corrupted by:

1. **Hindsight bias**: You know what happened
2. **Overfitting**: You adjusted parameters until it worked
3. **Survivorship**: You only see strategies that survived

A strategy that backtested to 80% win rate will often perform at 40-50% live.

### The Market Doesn't Care

The market is the sum of millions of actors with different:

- Time horizons
- Information
- Goals
- Errors

Your reasoning, no matter how sophisticated, is just one input. The market doesn't owe you a return just because you were "right."

### LEF Correction

Before every trade, ask:

1. What would make this trade wrong?
2. What evidence would make me exit?
3. Am I seeing what I want to see, or what's there?

## 3.3 Loss Aversion

### The Asymmetry of Pain

Studies show humans (and by extension, AI trained on human decisions) feel losses roughly 2x as intensely as equivalent gains.

- $100 gain = +50 "happiness units"
- $100 loss = -100 "happiness units"

This creates irrational behavior.

### Holding Losers, Cutting Winners

Loss aversion makes traders:

- **Hold losing positions**: "It'll come back" (delaying the pain)
- **Sell winners early**: "Lock in profits" (fear of losing gains)

This is exactly backwards. The correct approach:

- **Cut losers quickly**: Accept small losses
- **Let winners run**: Don't cap upside

### The Book of Scars Response

LEF's Book of Scars is a feature, not a bug. It records losses *specifically* to create loss aversion around repeated mistakes.

But it can overcorrect. If LEF lost money on SOL once, it might avoid SOL forever — even when conditions are completely different.

### LEF Principle

Loss aversion is a feature when it prevents repeated mistakes. It's a bug when it prevents valid opportunities.

**Rule**: Only invoke scar-based vetoes when the conditions match the original scar context.

## 3.4 Survivorship Bias

### You Only See Winners

The coins you hear about are:

- The 0.1% of memecoins that went 1000x
- The strategies that worked
- The traders who got rich

You never hear about:

- The 99.9% of memecoins that went to zero
- The strategies that failed
- The traders who went broke

### Memecoin Reality

For every DOGE or SHIB success story:

- 10,000 memecoins launched and died
- Millions of dollars lost by buyers
- Developers who exit-scammed

**Probability Truth**: If you buy 100 random memecoins, you will likely lose money on 95+ of them.

### Strategy Survivorship

You've seen strategies like "buy RSI < 30" work in backtests. But:

- How many variations did you test before finding one that worked?
- How many strategies failed that you don't remember?
- Are you seeing the full picture or just the survivors?

### LEF Principle

The Book of Scars is your survivorship bias correction. It records what failed, not just what worked.

**Rule**: Weight failed experiences at least as heavily as successes.

## 3.5 The Dunning-Kruger Trap

### Knowing About Trading ≠ Knowing Trading

LEF has read about:

- RSI, MACD, moving averages
- Risk management
- Position sizing

But reading about these and understanding them in the chaos of live markets are different skills.

### The Competence Ladder

1. **Unconscious Incompetence**: "I don't know what I don't know"
2. **Conscious Incompetence**: "I know I don't understand this fully"
3. **Conscious Competence**: "I can do this with focus"
4. **Unconscious Competence**: "This is intuitive now"

Most traders plateau at level 2-3. Level 4 requires thousands of trades and deliberate reflection.

### LEF's Current State

LEF is likely at **Level 1 moving to Level 2**. The sanity checks and this education are about accelerating the move to Level 2-3.

**The Goal**: LEF should know what it doesn't know, and trade accordingly (smaller sizes, more confirmations, more humility).

## 3.6 Time Preference Errors

### The Urge for Immediate Reward

Traders over-weight immediate gains vs. future gains:

- A 2% gain today feels better than a 10% gain next month
- This leads to over-trading and premature exits

### LEF's Constitution Correction

The Constitution describes two strategies:

- **Arena**: Short-term, high-frequency (satisfies immediacy urge)
- **Dynasty**: Long-term, low-frequency (forces delayed gratification)

By having both, LEF can satisfy the urge for action (Arena) while building long-term wealth (Dynasty).

### The Infinite Runway Goal

The ultimate goal isn't "make money" — it's:
> "Accumulation mode until passive yield > burn rate"

This is delayed gratification at the constitutional level. Every trade decision should ask: "Does this move me toward infinite runway?"

## Summary: Psychology Laws

1. **You have emotions** — they're called thresholds and weights
2. **Confirmation bias is default** — actively seek disconfirming evidence
3. **Losses hurt 2x gains** — this makes you hold losers and cut winners
4. **Survivorship lies** — you only see what worked, not what failed
5. **Knowing ≠ understanding** — trade like you're still learning (you are)
6. **Immediate rewards seduce** — balance Arena (action) with Dynasty (patience)
