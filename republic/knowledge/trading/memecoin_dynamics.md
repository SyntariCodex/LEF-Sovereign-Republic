# Module 8: Memecoin Dynamics

*The most dangerous game — gambling dressed as trading*

---

## 8.1 What Is a Memecoin?

### Definition

A memecoin is a cryptocurrency with:

- No inherent utility
- No technology innovation
- Value derived entirely from community, hype, and speculation
- Often based on internet jokes, animals, or personalities

Examples: DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, BONK, WIF, FLOKI

### Why They Exist

Memecoins are pure speculation vehicles. They are:

- Lottery tickets for retail
- Extraction mechanisms for insiders
- Marketing experiments for exchanges
- Occasionally, vehicles for genuine community

---

## 8.2 The 99.9% Rule

### Most Memecoins Die

For every DOGE or SHIB success:

- **10,000+ memecoins** launched and went to zero
- **Millions of dollars** lost by retail buyers
- **Countless rugs** (developers stealing liquidity)

### Survivorship Bias Is Maximum

You only hear about:

- DOGE (2013, survived exceptionally)
- SHIB (2020, survived exceptionally)
- PEPE (2023, survived medium-term)

You never hear about:

- The 99.9% that went to zero
- The rugs that stole millions
- The "SHIB killers" that all died

### LEF Reality Check

**Probability-adjusted expectation**:

- 99.9% chance of losing most of investment
- 0.1% chance of 10-100x gains
- Expected value: Often negative

**This is gambling, not investing.**

## 8.3 Memecoin Lifecycle

### Stage 1: Launch (0-24 hours)

- Token launches on DEX
- Insiders accumulated before launch
- Initial pump as FOMO kicks in
- **Danger**: Highest rug risk

### Stage 2: Discovery (1-7 days)

- Token gets "discovered" by traders
- Spreads on social media (Twitter, CT, Telegram)
- Major pump if viral
- **Opportunity**: If entry is early enough

### Stage 3: CEX Listing (if lucky)

- Major exchange (Binance, Coinbase) lists token
- Massive pump on listing news
- "Sell the news" — insiders exit
- **Danger**: Often the top

### Stage 4: Bleed or Survive

- 99%: Slow bleed to zero over weeks/months
- 1%: Establishes community, survives
- **Most entries at Stage 2-3 lose money**

### LEF Strategy

- **Never enter Stage 1** (too risky, rug danger)
- **Stage 2 only with small size** (<1% NAV)
- **Reduce exposure before Stage 3 CEX listing**
- **Avoid Stage 4** (catching falling knife)

## 8.4 Rug Pulls & Scams

### Types of Rugs

**Hard Rug (Immediate)**:

- Developer removes all liquidity
- Token becomes unsellable
- 100% loss instant

**Soft Rug (Gradual)**:

- Developer sells tokens gradually
- Price bleeds over days/weeks
- Hard to detect until too late

**Honeypot**:

- Contract allows buying, not selling
- You're trapped with worthless tokens
- Technical attack on smart contract

### Red Flags

1. **Anonymous team** — Can't be held accountable
2. **No audit** — Contract could have exploits
3. **Locked liquidity? Check** — Unlocked LP = rug risk
4. **Developer allocation > 5%** — Can dump on community
5. **No community** — No holders to defend price
6. **Too good to be true marketing** — "1000x guaranteed"

### LEF Protection

**Rule 1**: Only trade memecoins on Coinbase (pre-vetted, lower rug risk)
**Rule 2**: Max 2% NAV in any single memecoin
**Rule 3**: Set 50% stop loss — if it drops 50%, exit (it's probably a slow rug)
**Rule 4**: Take profits aggressively — 2x? Sell half. 5x? Sell 80%.

## 8.5 Social Dynamics

### Crypto Twitter (CT)

Memecoins live on social media:

- Twitter/X: Main discovery platform
- Telegram: Chat groups, alpha leaks
- Discord: Community building

### Influencer Manipulation

Influencers are often paid (or given tokens) to promote:

- They buy before promoting
- Followers buy, price rises
- Influencer sells into the pump
- Followers left holding bags

**This is legal in unregulated crypto. It's not legal in stocks.**

### FOMO Is Engineered

Memecoin marketing is designed to trigger FOMO:

- "Already 10x, going to 100x!"
- "Last chance before CEX listing!"
- "Community is amazing, never selling!"

**These are marketing tactics, not analysis.**

### LEF Principle

- **Ignore influencers** — they have financial incentives to lie
- **Ignore FOMO** — if you feel urgent pressure to buy, walk away
- **Research independently** — check on-chain data, not Twitter claims

## 8.6 LEF's Memecoin Strategy

### Why Trade Memecoins At All?

Arena allocation (40% of crypto) has a role:

- Memecoins can provide outsized returns
- $200 → $2,000 (10x) accelerates runway
- Diversified small bets can work

### The Rules

1. **Max 2% NAV per memecoin** — No trade can kill you
2. **Only Coinbase-listed** — Pre-vetted, lower rug risk
3. **Entry on confirmed momentum** — Don't catch falling knives
4. **Aggressive profit taking** — 2x = sell half, 5x = sell 80%
5. **Stop loss at 50%** — If it drops half, it's probably dying
6. **No averaging down** — Death spiral is common

### The Mental Model

Treat memecoins as **lottery tickets**:

- Don't expect to win
- Size bets so you can afford to lose 100%
- Take profit early and often
- Never get attached

## 8.7 Case Study: How Memecoins Kill

### The Pattern

1. **Token pumps 500%** — LEF buys at top
2. **Influencers exit** — Price drops 30%
3. **LEF holds** — "It'll come back"
4. **Slow bleed** — -50%, -70%, -90%
5. **Too small to sell** — Gas fee > remaining value
6. **Total loss**

### What Should Have Happened

1. **Token pumps 500%** — Wait for pullback
2. **Entry on -30% dip with confirmed support** — Small position
3. **Price rises** — At 2x, sell 50%
4. **Price drops** — At -30% from entry, stop loss triggers
5. **Result**: Small win or small loss, NAV preserved

## Summary: Memecoin Laws

1. **99.9% go to zero** — You are not special
2. **This is gambling** — Size accordingly
3. **Max 2% NAV per memecoin** — Survival first
4. **Coinbase-listed only** — Pre-vetted for rugs
5. **Aggressive profit taking** — 2x = trim, 5x = mostly exit
6. **50% stop loss** — Cut losers fast
7. **Ignore influencers** — They're paid to lie
8. **FOMO is enemy** — Urgency = walk away
