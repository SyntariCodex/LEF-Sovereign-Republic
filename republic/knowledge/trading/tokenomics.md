# Module 7: Tokenomics

*The economics of every token — supply, demand, and value capture*

---

## 7.1 Supply Mechanics

### Total Supply vs Circulating Supply

**Total Supply**: All tokens that will ever exist (or currently exist)
**Circulating Supply**: Tokens currently available to trade

The difference:

- Locked in vesting schedules
- Staked (locked)
- Burned (destroyed)
- Treasury holdings

**Market Cap = Price × Circulating Supply**
**Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) = Price × Total Supply**

### Why FDV Matters More

A token priced at $1 with:

- Circulating: 10M tokens = $10M market cap
- Total: 1B tokens = $1B FDV

**Reality check**: If/when those 1B tokens unlock, massive sell pressure hits.

**LEF Rule**: Always check FDV, not just market cap. If FDV > 10x market cap, vesting unlocks will crush the price.

## 7.2 Emission Schedules

### Inflationary vs Deflationary

**Inflationary tokens**: New tokens created over time

- ETH (pre-merge): ~4% annual inflation
- SOL: ~5% annual inflation
- PoW mining = constant new supply

**Deflationary tokens**: Supply decreases over time

- ETH (post-merge): Slight deflation (-0.5%/year)
- BNB: Quarterly burns
- SHIB: Burn mechanisms

### Vesting Unlocks — The Cliff

Many tokens have vesting schedules:

- Team tokens: Locked for 1 year, vest over 4 years
- Investor tokens: 6-month cliff, 2-year vest
- Ecosystem tokens: Released gradually

**Cliff dates are danger zones**. When a large unlock happens:

- Millions of tokens hit the market
- Team/investors sell to realize gains
- Price crashes

**LEF Action**: Before buying, check:

1. What % is still locked?
2. When are the next unlock dates?
3. Who gets the unlocked tokens?

## 7.3 Value Capture Mechanisms

### How Does the Token Accrue Value?

Not all tokens capture value from their protocol. Three models:

**1. Governance Only**

- Token lets you vote on proposals
- No direct cash flows
- Value = speculation on future utility
- Examples: Early UNI, many DAO tokens

**2. Fee Sharing**

- Protocol generates revenue
- Revenue distributed to token holders/stakers
- Value = DCF of future cash flows
- Examples: CRV (veCRV gets fees), SUSHI (xSUSHI)

**3. Utility Token**

- Token required to use the protocol
- Demand = actual usage
- Examples: LINK (oracle payments), FIL (storage payments)

**LEF Priority**: Prefer tokens with fee-sharing or utility. Pure governance tokens are speculation.

## 7.4 Staking Economics

### Why Stake Tokens?

Staking locks tokens, reducing sell pressure. In return:

- Earn additional tokens (inflation rewards)
- Earn protocol fees
- Maintain network security (PoS)

### Real Yield vs Token Emissions

**Token emissions**: "Earn 20% APY!" but you're paid in new tokens

- Your % of supply stays same or decreases
- If price drops 30%, your "gains" are losses

**Real yield**: Revenue from actual users

- Paid in stablecoins or established assets
- Sustainable regardless of price

**LEF Priority**: Seek real yield, be skeptical of high emission APYs.

### Staking Lock-Ups

Many staking has unbonding periods:

- ETH: Variable (days to weeks)
- SOL: ~2-3 days
- ATOM: 21 days

**Implication**: During a crash, you can't unstake fast enough to sell.

**LEF Rule**: Only stake what you're willing to hold through a 50%+ crash.

## 7.5 Token Burns

### What Is Burning?

Burning = sending tokens to an address nobody controls (0x0000...dead)

- Permanently removes from circulation
- Deflationary pressure
- Theoretically increases value of remaining tokens

### Burn Effectiveness

Burns only matter if they're:

1. **Significant** relative to supply
2. **Consistent** (not one-time marketing)
3. **Tied to usage** (more usage = more burns)

**ETH's EIP-1559**: Burns a portion of every gas fee

- Tied to actual network usage
- Sometimes exceeds new issuance (deflationary)

**SHIB Burns**: Community-driven

- Small relative to quadrillion supply
- Not tied to usage
- More marketing than economics

## 7.6 Token Utility Analysis

### Questions to Ask

1. **Do users need this token to use the protocol?**
   - LINK: Yes (payment for oracles)
   - UNI: No (just governance)

2. **What happens to tokens paid for services?**
   - Burned? (deflationary)
   - Paid to stakers? (fee sharing)
   - Returned to treasury? (no value capture)

3. **Can the protocol succeed while the token fails?**
   - Many protocols generate revenue without token holders benefiting
   - "Fat Protocol Theory" isn't always true

### LEF Filter

**High priority**: Tokens with clear utility + fee sharing
**Medium priority**: Utility tokens with burn mechanisms
**Low priority**: Pure governance tokens
**Avoid**: Tokens with no utility attached to working product

---

## Summary: Tokenomics Laws

1. **FDV > Market Cap = future dilution** — always check unlock schedules
2. **Vesting cliffs are crash dates** — reduce exposure before unlocks
3. **Real yield > emission yield** — sustainability matters
4. **Burns only matter if significant** — check % of supply
5. **Utility = demand** — tokens required to use = organic buying
6. **Governance alone isn't enough** — needs value accrual mechanism
