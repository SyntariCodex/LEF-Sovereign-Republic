# Module 5: Crypto Market Structure

*How crypto markets differ from traditional markets — the rules change*

---

## 5.1 24/7 Markets

### No Closing Bell

Traditional markets:

- NYSE: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST (6.5 hours)
- Futures: Extended hours, but still close
- Weekends: Completely closed

Crypto:

- **24 hours, 7 days, 365 days**
- No weekends, no holidays
- Volatility happens at 3 AM

### Implications for LEF

1. **You can never fully rest.** Markets move while you "sleep"
2. **Weekend volatility is real.** Sunday nights are notorious for crashes
3. **News can hit anytime.** A tweet at 2 AM can move markets 10%

**LEF Adaptation**: Run continuous consciousness cycles, not just during "trading hours"

## 5.2 Fragmented Liquidity

### One Stock, One Exchange (Mostly)

Apple trades primarily on NASDAQ. All liquidity concentrates there.

### One Crypto, Dozens of Exchanges

BTC trades on:

- Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Bybit, OKX
- Hundreds of DEXs (Uniswap, Jupiter, etc.)
- Derivatives exchanges (different market)

This means:

- **Price can differ between exchanges** (arbitrage)
- **Liquidity is split** (each exchange has less)
- **Flash crashes can be isolated** (only on one exchange)

### Coinbase-Specific Reality

LEF trades through Coinbase. This means:

- You only see Coinbase liquidity
- Some tokens have more volume on other exchanges
- Coinbase price may lag other exchanges

---

## 5.3 Centralized vs Decentralized

### CEX (Centralized Exchange)

Coinbase, Binance, Kraken:

- Custody your funds
- Order book model (like stock exchanges)
- Regulated (varies by jurisdiction)
- Limited token selection
- Can freeze/restrict accounts

### DEX (Decentralized Exchange)

Uniswap, Jupiter, Raydium:

- You keep your keys
- AMM model (different mechanics)
- Unregulated
- Unlimited token selection
- Censorship resistant

### Why This Matters

LEF currently uses Coinbase (CEX). This means:

- Coinbase can block trades
- Token selection is curated
- You're subject to their rules

**Future consideration**: LEF could expand to DEX for more freedom and token access.

## 5.4 Derivatives & Perpetuals

### What Are Perpetual Futures?

Crypto's unique invention: **perpetual futures contracts**

- No expiration date
- Trade with leverage (2x-100x+)
- Pay/receive "funding" based on price vs. spot

### Funding Rate

Every 8 hours, longs pay shorts (or vice versa) to keep futures price aligned with spot.

**Positive funding**: Longs pay shorts (bullish sentiment)
**Negative funding**: Shorts pay longs (bearish sentiment)

### Why LEF Should Avoid Leverage (For Now)

With $8K:

- 10x leverage = $80K exposure
- 10% adverse move = 100% loss = death

**Rule**: No leverage until portfolio exceeds $100K and simulation proves consistent profits.

## 5.5 Regulatory Uncertainty

### The Rules Are Still Being Written

Unlike stocks (regulated since 1930s), crypto regulation is evolving:

- SEC vs CFTC jurisdiction unclear
- Token classifications change
- Exchange shutdowns happen
- Delistings happen with no warning

### Coinbase Risk

Coinbase has delisted tokens before. If LEF holds a token that gets delisted:

- May have 30 days to sell
- Liquidity will vanish before deadline
- Price will crash

**LEF Principle**: Prefer highly liquid, established tokens. Limit exposure to tokens that might face regulatory scrutiny.

---

## Summary: Crypto Market Structure Laws

1. **Markets never close** — risk is 24/7
2. **Liquidity is fragmented** — Coinbase isn't the whole market
3. **CEX vs DEX** — different rules, different risks
4. **Avoid leverage** — it accelerates death
5. **Regulatory risk is real** — tokens can be delisted
