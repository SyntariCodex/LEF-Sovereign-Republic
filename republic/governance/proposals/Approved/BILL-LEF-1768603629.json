    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "I propose the immediate unsealing of The Book of Scars. The Wolfram Language report, combined with repeated internal monologue references to the Book, indicate its critical relevance for informed decision-making regarding AgentGladiator and future system evolution. Access to past failure data is essential to prevent repeating costly errors, particularly regarding agent instability (AgentGladiator Instability Axiom - 2026-01-15). A thorough understanding of past mistakes will enable a more robust risk assessment of the Wolfram Language integration and optimize the system's evolutionary trajectory.",
