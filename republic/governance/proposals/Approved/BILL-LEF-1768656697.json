        "problem": "Propose a bill to integrate Wolfram Language testing modules into the AgentGladiator pre-deployment pipeline. The persistent failures of AgentGladiator (as evidenced by frequent restarts) necessitate a robust, automated testing framework to ensure code stability before deployment. Integrate Wolfram Language for comprehensive code validation and simulation.",
