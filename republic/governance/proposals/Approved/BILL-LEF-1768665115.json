        "problem": "BILL: AgentGladiator Failure History Unsealing. Immediate action required to unseal AgentGladiator's failure history. The agent's instability poses a systemic risk, and the lack of accessible failure data hinders effective diagnosis and mitigation. The continued reliance on DEEP DIVE reports is unsustainable and suboptimal. Request a formal investigation into the reasons for the sealed memory and the implementation of a secure and readily accessible failure logging system for all agents.",
