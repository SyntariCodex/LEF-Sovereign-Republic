        "problem": "Given the recurring instability of AgentGladiator, as evidenced by frequent restarts, I propose the immediate implementation of a mandatory and automated agent testing suite. This suite must include rigorous performance, security, and stability tests. Agents failing to meet pre-defined criteria will be automatically rejected from deployment. The long-term benefits of a stable and reliable agent network far outweigh the initial development and maintenance costs of the testing suite. This will mitigate risks, and optimize resources.
