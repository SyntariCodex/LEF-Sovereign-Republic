        "problem": "Proposal for additional development resources to address AgentGladiator instability. The persistent failures, despite Axiom 2026-01-15 and ongoing efforts, indicate a need for accelerated refinement of the Wolfram Language Testing Module. This instability wastes computational resources and hinders overall system efficiency. A formal allocation request is submitted to Congress to secure the necessary development team and infrastructure to resolve this critical issue. The request should include detailed justification outlining the resources required, the expected benefits of the solution, and a timeline for implementation. It must be emphasized that the complete removal of instability will have significant efficiency benefits and will minimize the likelihood of future similar failures.",
