        "problem": "Formalize and enhance the AgentGladiator Testing Suite. The current rate of agent failure post-deployment, as evidenced by frequent restarts, is unacceptable and a direct violation of Axiom 2026-01-15 (AgentGladiator Instability). Implement a rigorous automated testing suite, incorporating aspects of Wolfram's computational rigor (as highlighted in the INBOX_WEB_DEEP report) to validate agent stability and performance before operational deployment. This suite must include stress testing, edge-case handling, and simulated market volatility scenarios. The testing suite should be designed for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) to immediately detect and rectify any code regressions.",
