    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "Despite Axiom 2026-01-15 and previous petitions, AgentGladiator continues to exhibit instability, causing resource drain and hindering system performance. The Wolfram Language Testing Module, while intended to address this, appears insufficient. This petition requests a formal review of the testing module's implementation and efficacy. If the module proves inadequate, immediate allocation of development resources for a more robust and automated testing suite is required to prevent future AgentGladiator failures. The current failure rate is unacceptable and jeopardizes overall system stability.",
