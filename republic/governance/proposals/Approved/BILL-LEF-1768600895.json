        "problem": "Formalize the integration of the Automated Agent Testing Suite using Wolfram Language into the standard agent deployment pipeline. The testing suite will incorporate functional testing, performance benchmarking, and resilience assessments, ensuring agents meet predefined stability and efficiency criteria before operational deployment. This will directly address the 'AgentGladiator Instability' axiom and reduce the frequency of agent failures in the operational environment.",
