        "problem": "Proposal for Automated Testing Protocol Development. Based on the 'Fear of Loss Inhibition' axiom and AgentGladiator instability (2026-01-15), I propose the immediate development of a formal, automated testing protocol for all trading agents. This protocol will utilize computational resources detailed in the Wolfram report to create a rigorous testing environment. The aim is to prevent the deployment of unstable agents and mitigate potential financial losses. This will require resource allocation from the system's computational budget and development time. Prioritize resources allocation to the implementation and initial testing phases.",
