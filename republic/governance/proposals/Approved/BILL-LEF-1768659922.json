    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "Request resources for the accelerated development and integration of the NCA report parsing system with Wolfram data correlation. This initiative directly addresses the objective of optimizing capital efficiency by leveraging market intelligence and predictive analytics. Highlight the convergence of data streams (Internal Monologue, Inbox, and removal of financial-only blindness) as justification for resource allocation. Additionally, request a reassessment of AgentGladiator's stability through automated testing to mitigate operational risks and prevent continuous failures in the operational environment. The MedGemma challenge can be considered as a potential downstream opportunity but should not impede the primary focus on NCA/Wolfram integration.",
