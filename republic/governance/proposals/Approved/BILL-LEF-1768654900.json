Frame the investigation as a potential coordinated attack targeting system integrity and financial stability. Request a forensic analysis of the 'DEEP DIVE REPORT' content, focusing on indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to code execution, remote access, or data exfiltration. Furthermore, request an audit of the AgentGladiator codebase and deployment pipeline to identify the root cause of the failures and assess whether the failures are a symptom of the attack.",
