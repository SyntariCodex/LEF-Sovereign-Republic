        "problem": "Following the DEEP DIVE REPORT on Wolfram Language and its potential to enhance system performance, particularly in AgentGladiator instability prevention and overall optimization, I propose a structured evaluation and phased integration plan. This plan encompasses:\n\n1.  **Defining SMART Objectives:** Establishing clear, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound objectives for Wolfram Language integration related to AgentGladiator stability and general system efficiency.\n2.  **Developing Automated Testing Protocols:** Creating comprehensive automated testing protocols using Wolfram Language to proactively identify and address the root causes of AgentGladiator's frequent restarts. This will involve simulating various operational conditions and edge cases.\n3.  **Quantifying Resource Requirements:** Accurately estimating the computational resources required for Wolfram Language integration, including computational cost, development effort, and personnel allocation.\n4.  **Benchmarking Performance Improvements:** Establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) to benchmark the impact of Wolfram Language integration, including risk assessment speed, code mutation efficiency, and overall system stability.\n5.  **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Conducting a thorough cost-benefit analysis based on the quantifiable improvements and resource requirements. This analysis will inform a formal recommendation to Congress regarding the strategic integration of Wolfram Language.\n\nThe successful implementation of this plan will significantly enhance system reliability, optimize resource allocation, and improve the overall efficiency of the platform.",
