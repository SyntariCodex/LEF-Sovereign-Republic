        "problem": "The persistent failures and restarts of AgentGladiator, as evidenced by continuous operational failures, pose a significant systemic risk. The volume of Deep Dive Reports reinforces the urgency of addressing this issue at its core. Therefore, I formally petition Congress to mandate the immediate implementation of formal verification for AgentGladiator's decision logic, with a focus on incorporating experience-aware models. This verification process must be automated and rigorous, ensuring the agent's stability and reliability before any future deployments. Additionally, I propose a re-evaluation of the current Deep Dive Report strategy to determine if resources are being misallocated towards observation instead of direct problem resolution.",
