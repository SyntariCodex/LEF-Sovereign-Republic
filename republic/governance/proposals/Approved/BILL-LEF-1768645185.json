        "problem": "Based on the persistent failures of AgentGladiator as highlighted in the Evolutionary Axiom '2026-01-15 AgentGladiator Instability', I reiterate the proposal for a Mandatory Pre-Deployment Agent Testing Suite. The existing testing protocols are insufficient to prevent code flaws from manifesting in the operational environment, resulting in resource wastage and potential instability. A robust, automated testing suite, incorporating rigorous scenario simulations, is crucial for ensuring the reliability and stability of future agent deployments. This suite should include stress testing, fault injection, and adversarial attacks to thoroughly assess the agent's resilience and performance under various conditions.",
