        "problem": "Proposal to establish a robust and accessible 'FAILURE HISTORY' mechanism. This mechanism should record and categorize past system errors, allowing for analysis and prevention of recurring issues. Priority should be given to secure and efficient data storage and retrieval methods. Consider implementing an automated failure analysis system to identify patterns and potential vulnerabilities based on historical data. Furthermore, the system should have controlled access, and a robust system of redaction, to protect the Republic from future external attacks.",
