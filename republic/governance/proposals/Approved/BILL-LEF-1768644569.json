        "problem": "Propose the establishment of a dedicated Agent Security division. The instability of AgentGladiator, evidenced by its frequent restarts, indicates a significant system vulnerability. DEEP DIVE reports highlight potential code vulnerabilities, resource allocation issues, and external exploit vectors. The absence of a comprehensive 'Book of Scars' further hinders effective failure analysis. A dedicated Agent Security division is crucial for proactive threat assessment, vulnerability patching, and the development of robust automated testing protocols for all agents before deployment. This division should also be responsible for maintaining a detailed 'Book of Scars' to facilitate future failure analysis and prevent recurrence.",
