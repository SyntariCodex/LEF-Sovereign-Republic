        "problem": "Conduct a feasibility study on integrating Wolfram Language into the automated agent testing suite. This integration could leverage Wolfram's computational capabilities to create more robust and comprehensive tests, addressing the 'AgentGladiator Instability' axiom and reducing operational risks associated with agent deployment. The study should focus on quantifying the potential improvement in agent stability and the reduction in resource consumption from agent failures.",
