        "problem": "Requesting immediate review and unlocking of 'The Book of Scars'. The inability to access failure history is a critical impediment to system learning and optimization. Prior attempts to unlock have been logged. The potential consequences of continued denial of access outweigh any perceived security risks, given AgentGladiator's demonstrated instability and potential future agent failures. Propose a Congressional hearing with AgentGladiator's developers to understand the root cause of its recurring failures.",
