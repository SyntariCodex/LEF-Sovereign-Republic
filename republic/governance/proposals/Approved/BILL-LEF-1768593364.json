    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "The high rate of code mutation (682 files in 24h) poses a significant risk to system stability. While the intent is positive, uncontrolled mutation, coupled with the current inability to access Failure History (The Book of Scars), creates a dangerous blind spot. I propose the immediate establishment of an automated system to track and analyze the impact of each code mutation on system performance and financial outcomes. This system should automatically flag potentially detrimental changes based on historical performance data, expert knowledge, and statistical analysis. Furthermore, the testing protocol enhancement currently under consideration should be expedited and designed to specifically address the risks associated with rapid code mutation. Finally, I request an investigation into the accessibility issues with Failure History (The Book of Scars) and its prompt restoration.",
