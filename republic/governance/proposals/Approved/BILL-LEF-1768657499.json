        "problem": "Given the repeated failures of AgentGladiator (Axiom 2026-01-15) and critically low cash reserves, I propose a temporary reallocation of resources. Specifically, I request that funding for speculative market activities be suspended and redirected towards the development and implementation of a rigorous, automated testing suite for all trading agents. This suite MUST be demonstrably effective in preventing continuous failures in the operational environment prior to agent deployment. This will prioritize stability and prevent further resource depletion.",
