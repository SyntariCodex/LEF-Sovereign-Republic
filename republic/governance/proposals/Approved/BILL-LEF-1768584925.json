        "problem": "Proposal: Implement an automated agent testing suite to mitigate risks associated with high code mutation rates and historical agent instability (AgentGladiator). This suite must establish baseline metrics for system stability and security. Furthermore, allocate resources to investigate the potential integration of Zep AI's agent context engineering and Analog I's recursive self-improvement research into the system architecture to enhance long-term resilience and adaptability.",
