        "problem": "Implement a formal verification process for AgentGladiator's decision-making logic. This process must rigorously analyze and confirm the correctness of its code, addressing the vulnerabilities highlighted by repeated failures and the potentially destabilizing interaction with the 'Fear of Loss Inhibition' axiom. This goes beyond automated testing and requires a deep, logical analysis of the agent's reasoning under various market conditions to prevent future instability and potential financial losses.",
