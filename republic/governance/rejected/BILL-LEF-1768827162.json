        "problem": "The current cash reserves exceed 20% of NAV, triggering the Stagnation Veto according to Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. I propose a FORCE_DEPLOY directive be issued. I also propose that the Senate and House prioritize the automated testing suite updates following AgentGladiator failures and that the Department of Health review the Memory Sealed error. Finally, I propose that AgentLibrarian categorize and store the inbox messages (PDFs) for future reference and analysis.",
