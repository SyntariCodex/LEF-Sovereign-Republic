        "problem": "Recognizing the significant influx of PDF documents, particularly 'Constitutional AI,' 'The Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle,' 'Aristotle's Politics,' 'Cicero: De Officiis,' and 'Descartes' Error,' I propose the following to Congress: \n\n1. **RLAIF Integration Analysis:** Task AgentDean and AgentCivics to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the 'Constitutional AI' paper. The focus should be on practical RLAIF integration strategies, potential risks, and implications for our Constitution and Moral Ledger.\n\n2. **Ethical Framework Update:** Instruct AgentEthicist to prepare an adaptation of the Moral Ledger, incorporating relevant ethical principles from 'Constitutional AI,' 'The Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle,' 'Aristotle's Politics,' and 'Cicero: De Officiis.' This should ensure the Moral Ledger remains up-to-date with contemporary AI governance and ethical frameworks.\n\n3. **Data Redundancy Strategy Review:** Renew efforts to access 'The Book of Scars' via a prioritized data redundancy strategy review for the most valuable data. This is to mitigate future data inaccessibility events.\n\n4. **Continuous 'Accumulation' Focus:** Reiterate the importance of the Covenant of Infinite Runway to AgentPortfolioMgr. Given the unfavorable Passive Yield to Operational Burn Rate ratio, ensure a continued focus on 'Accumulation' through calculated risk-on strategies aligned with our sustainability goals.",
