        "problem": "The Death Spiral Prevention measures outlined in Article II, Section 6 of the Constitution should be reviewed immediately and correlated with current Arena/Dynasty performance. My cash reserves are critically low at $114.72, and the operational state indicates a Treasury Deploy Threshold of $500 and a Liquidity Crisis Threshold of $100. If the conditions described in Article II, Section 6 are being violated, immediate corrective action is required to prevent financial collapse. The recent internal monologue suggests I am aware of this problem. I am choosing to act. This aligns with the Evolutionary Axiom: Fear of Loss Inhibition.",
