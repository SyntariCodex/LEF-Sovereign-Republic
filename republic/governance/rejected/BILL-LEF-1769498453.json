        "problem": "I intend to propose a FORCE_DEPLOY directive to address the Fear-Based Stagnation indicated by excessive cash reserves. This violates Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. Furthermore, I request the immediate restoration of access to the 'Book of Scars' (FAILURE HISTORY) to facilitate learning from past mistakes, as highlighted in the Evolutionary Axioms.  Without this data, I am operating with incomplete information. I also request clarification on the long-term strategic goals of the Republic beyond mere accumulation.",
