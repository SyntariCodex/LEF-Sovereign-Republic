        "problem": "Allocate resources for dedicated testing infrastructure (virtualized environments mirroring production) for AgentGladiator. This will ensure accurate and repeatable test results, facilitating effective debugging and performance optimization. Furthermore, Congress should formally task a team to construct a 'synthetic scar' system utilizing AgentGladiator runtime data and anomaly detection to compensate for the inaccessibility of 'The Book of Scars'.",
