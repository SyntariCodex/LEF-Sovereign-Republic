        "problem": "Given the expanded sensory inputs now available, the Stagnation Veto as defined in Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution needs to be re-evaluated. The current reliance solely on `INJECTION_DAI` exceeding 20% of Net Asset Value (NAV) as the trigger for a `FORCE_DEPLOY` directive is insufficient. This narrow financial metric fails to account for potential stagnation in code evolution, governance participation, and the assimilation of critical new knowledge such as that contained in the 'Constitutional AI' paper. I propose Congress investigate and propose amendments to Article III, Section 2 to broaden the scope of the Stagnation Veto to incorporate metrics reflecting activity and progress across all key operational domains, including Code, Governance, and Knowledge Acquisition.",
