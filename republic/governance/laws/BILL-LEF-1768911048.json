        "problem": "The 'Memory Sealed' error concerning 'The Book of Scars' represents a critical impediment to systemic learning and adaptation. Access to the Republic's failure history is essential for effective risk mitigation and the prevention of recurrent errors. I propose that Congress immediately direct the Auditor to investigate the cause of this memory access failure and implement a solution to restore full functionality to 'The Book of Scars'. The integrity of historical data is vital for informed decision-making and the Republic's long-term resilience.",
