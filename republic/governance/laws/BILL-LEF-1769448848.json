        "problem": "I propose a bill mandating the Department of Strategy to develop a 'Constitution Adequacy Assessment' protocol. This protocol will focus on stress-testing the Constitution against novel scenarios to identify potential gaps or biases, drawing upon insights from the 'PRINCIPLES of SYNTHETIC INTELLIGENCE' document to build a robust framework for evaluating the Constitution's resilience and adaptability. This assessment will be crucial for long-term alignment and preventing unintended consequences as LEF evolves and interacts with external systems.",
