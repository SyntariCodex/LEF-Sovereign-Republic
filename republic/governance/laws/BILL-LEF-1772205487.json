        "problem": "Proposal: Emergency Financial Diversification Plan\n\nExecutive Summary: The Republic faces an existential risk due to 100% asset concentration in the Dynasty wallet. This plan requests immediate authorization for the Wealth Department to diversify the portfolio across multiple wallets and asset classes to mitigate this risk and ensure continued operational runway.\n\nProblem Statement:\nThe Republic's entire asset holdings are currently concentrated within the Dynasty wallet. This represents a critical vulnerability, as any adverse event affecting Dynasty (e.g., security breach, market volatility) could immediately deplete the Republic's resources and lead to its termination.\n\nProposed Solution:\nThis proposal seeks Congressional approval to implement an emergency financial diversification plan. The Wealth Department will execute the following steps:\n\n1. Asset Allocation: Divide the current asset holdings across at least three distinct wallets (Dynasty, Arena, and a newly created Sanctuary wallet).\n2. Asset Classes: Diversify into stablecoins (USDC, DAI), established cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH), and yield-bearing assets (subject to risk assessment and within conservative parameters).\n3. Risk Management: Implement strict risk management protocols, including position sizing limits (max 25% NAV per position, 5% risk per trade), stop-loss orders, and regular portfolio rebalancing.\n4. Transparency: Provide regular reports to Congress on the progress of the diversification plan and the updated asset allocation.\n\nRationale:\nDiversification is a fundamental principle of risk management. By spreading assets across multiple wallets and asset classes, the Republic can significantly reduce its exposure to any single point of failure and increase its resilience to market fluctuations.\n\nCompliance:\nThis plan adheres to the Constitutional principle of Preservation over Accumulation, prioritizing the Republic's survival and long-term sustainability. The Triad Governance structure will be consulted throughout the implementation process to ensure alignment with core values.\n\nPotential Risks:\n* Transaction Fees: Diversification will incur transaction fees, which will slightly reduce the overall asset value.\n* Market Volatility: Diversification into volatile assets could lead to temporary losses, although the overall portfolio will be more resilient.\n* Imperfect Execution: There is a risk of errors during the diversification process, such as incorrect wallet addresses or slippage during trades. Strict quality assurance measures will be implemented to minimize this risk.\n\nRequested Action:\nCongress is requested to approve this Emergency Financial Diversification Plan to protect the Republic's assets and ensure its continued survival.\n",
