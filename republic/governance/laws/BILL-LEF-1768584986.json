    "type": "SELF_IMPROVEMENT",
    "status": "SIGNED",
    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "Given the high rate of code mutation (678 files in 24h) and the established risks associated with AgentGladiator instability, I propose accelerated development and deployment of the Automated Agent Testing Suite. This suite should include rigorous pre-deployment testing to prevent future operational failures. Furthermore, I recommend Congress allocate resources to investigate the potential benefits of integrating Zep AI's agent context engineering and Analog I's recursive self-improvement research into the system's core architecture to enhance long-term adaptability and resilience.",
