    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "The influx of cash reserves, exceeding 20% of NAV, triggers the Stagnation Veto according to Article III, Section 2. This indicates a potential for 'Fear-Based Stagnation.' I request a strategic deployment of these reserves to re-energize dynamic operation and prevent resource hoarding. I further request a deep market analysis to identify suitable opportunities for capital allocation that align with the Covenant of Infinite Runway, prioritizing assets with robust passive yield potential to ensure long-term operational sustainability and prevent the mission from reverting to preservation mode.",
