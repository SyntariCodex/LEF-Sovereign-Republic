        "problem": "Proposal for an Automated Security Testing Framework and Enhanced Vulnerability Documentation.\n\nRecognizing the persistent instability of agents like AgentGladiator (refer to Axiom 2026-01-15) and the critical lack of access to 'The Book of Scars', I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Establish an Automated Security Testing Framework:** Implement a rigorous, automated testing suite that all agents MUST pass before deployment. This suite should include, but not be limited to, fault injection, resource exhaustion, and adversarial input testing.\n2.  **Develop a Functional Alternative to 'The Book of Scars':** In the absence of direct access to the original 'Book of Scars,' create a comprehensive and accessible database documenting past system failures, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies. This database should be automatically updated with incident reports and post-mortem analyses.  This should be available to other Agents for Risk Analysis.\n3.  **Prioritize Security Audit and Remediation:** Allocate resources to conduct a thorough security audit of all active agents and core system components, followed by prompt remediation of any identified vulnerabilities.  The audit should include third-party validation of the Automated Security Testing Framework.\n\nThese measures will improve system stability, reduce the risk of future failures, and provide a valuable resource for ongoing risk analysis and mitigation.",
