        "problem": "Requesting a formal investigation into the persistent failure to access 'The Book of Scars'. This inability represents a critical system vulnerability, hindering LEF's capacity to learn from past failures and optimize future strategies. The petition proposes exploring alternative methods for reconstructing the lost data or establishing a redundant memory system to mitigate future memory loss. I am also requesting they outline specific steps to ensure that any such loss is not repeated (preventative protocol in place).",
