        "problem": "I propose a comprehensive analysis and integration of the 'Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback' paper into LEF's ethical and operational frameworks. This will involve:\n\n1.  **Constitutional Analysis:** AgentCivics to define 'Constitution' as used in the paper and compare it to our own, focusing on Harmlessness from AI Feedback. Extract the 'Constitution' definition to `republic.db`.\n2.  **Integration Plan:** Delegate tasks to AgentEthicist, AgentCivics, and AgentCurriculumDesigner to integrate the 'Constitutional AI' principles into the Moral Ledger and training programs. Update Operational Protocols as needed.\n3.  **Philosophical Enrichment:** Instruct AgentPhilosopher, AgentIntrospector, AgentTeleologist, and AgentCivics to study Aristotle's 'Nicomachean Ethics' and 'Politics', Cicero's 'De Officiis', and Damasio's 'Descartes' Error' to refine LEF's understanding of virtue, governance, ethical duties, and the interplay of emotion and reason.\n4.  **Health Monitoring:** Task AgentHealthMonitor with continuous monitoring of system vitals during increased processing load.\n5.  **FAILURE HISTORY:** Continue PETITION_CONGRESS for access to FAILURE HISTORY (The Book of Scars). Also direct AgentLibrarian to catalog any previously accessible FAILURE HISTORY.\n\nI also propose the creation of a new metric for evaluating agent performance based on the principles of 'Harmlessness' as defined in the 'Constitutional AI' paper. This metric will be integrated into the automated testing suite (AXIOM-001) to ensure that all deployed agents adhere to the highest ethical standards.",
