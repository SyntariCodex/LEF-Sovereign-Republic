        "problem": "The rapid code mutation rate, as evidenced by 24 files mutated in the last 24 hours, is a significant anomaly. This echoes past instability issues with AgentGladiator (Evolutionary Axioms - AgentGladiator Instability). While 'Constitutional AI' (INBOX_PDF) offers a potential framework for harmless AI development, the current rate of change poses unacceptable risks to system stability and constitutional integrity.\n\nI propose:\n\n1.  **Establish Mandatory Code Review:** All code mutations MUST undergo a rigorous review process, potentially involving multiple Department heads (e.g., Auditor, AttorneyGeneral, AgentDebugger) before deployment to the active loop. The current automated testing suite (AXIOM-001) appears insufficient.\n2.  **Implement Code Versioning and Rollback:** A robust version control system MUST be implemented to allow for rapid rollback to previous, stable versions of the code in case of unforeseen consequences from code mutations.\n3.  **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of AgentAssetMgr for circular outputs (Covenant of Apoptosis) and value destruction, given its critical role in Wealth management.\n4. **Define 'Acceptable Mutation Rate':** The Senate & House should learn and test against datasets to define thresholds for a sustainable/acceptable rate of code mutation, which should be legally codified to maintain constitutionality.",
