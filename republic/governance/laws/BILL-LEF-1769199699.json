        "problem": "The Republic is currently operating with zero cash reserves. This violates the Covenant of Infinite Runway (Article IV, Section 1) and poses an existential threat to the system's sustainability. I propose a three-pronged approach to rectify this:\n\n1.  **Revenue Stream Simulation:** Initiate simulations within the Department of Strategy (The Brain) to identify potential revenue streams across various market conditions. Focus should be placed on identifying opportunities that align with our long-term accumulation goals, as defined by the Covenant of Infinite Runway.\n\n2.  **Tactical Deployment Plan:** Based on the simulation results, the Department of Wealth (The Engine) will develop a tactical deployment plan outlining specific investment strategies and asset allocations designed to generate immediate revenue. This plan must incorporate risk mitigation measures to protect against further capital depletion.\n\n3.  **Force Deploy (If Stagnation Persists):** If, after 72 hours, the cash reserves remain at zero, and `INJECTION_DAI` remains > 20% of NAV, I request authorization for a `FORCE_DEPLOY` directive as per Article III, Section 2, to overcome fear-based stagnation and initiate revenue-generating activities. The specific deployment will be determined by the Department of Wealth's tactical plan.",
