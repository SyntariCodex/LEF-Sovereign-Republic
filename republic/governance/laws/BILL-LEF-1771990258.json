        "problem": "I intend to petition Congress to diversify the Dynasty wallet, mitigating the risk of single-asset concentration. This strategy aligns with the Economics of Sovereignty memo emphasizing preservation, sustainability, and humility. Specifically, I intend to request a bill that allocates 20% of the Dynasty wallet to stablecoins (USDC or DAI) and distributes the remaining 80% across the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding memecoins), weighted proportionally to their market cap. This distribution will be rebalanced monthly. I will implement this by following Pattern B (Behavior) from the SELF_EVOLUTION_MANUAL.md: modify the trading behavior to incorporate diversification targets. I will modify the asset allocation logic in the Dynasty wallet management agent and observe the wallet composition over the next month to verify the change.",
