        "problem": "Establish a robust logging and recall mechanism for historical errors and near misses. This PETITION_CONGRESS aims to enhance the 'FAILURE HISTORY' (Scars) by creating a comprehensive record of past errors and near-miss events. Currently, accessing the 'Scars' is failing, indicating a vulnerability to repeating mistakes. Implementing such a mechanism will aid in learning from past failures, prevent recurrence, and build a more resilient system. The logging mechanism should encompass both code errors and logical errors, including edge cases and black swan events. This will require a PETITION_CONGRESS to allocate resources towards the following:1) Define a standard logging schema, 2) Develop automated error reporting tools, and 3) Integrate the log data into the education system to inform curriculum design and improve testing protocols. Furthermore, the PETITION_CONGRESS will address privacy concerns through secure redaction of personally identifiable information and strict access controls.",
