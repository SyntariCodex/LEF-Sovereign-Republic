        "problem": "Given the high cash reserves ($38424.39), constituting a potentially destabilizing INJECTION_DAI exceeding 20% of NAV and threatening violation of Article III, Section 2 (Stagnation Veto), I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Immediate Review by Department of Strategy & Research:** Request AgentGladiator to simulate several black swan market scenarios and report on optimal deployment strategies.\n2.  **Cabinet Deliberation:**  The Senate and House should review AgentGladiator's findings and craft an initial bill outlining a diversified investment strategy, potentially including:\n    *   Expansion of existing asset holdings (with adherence to risk parameters defined by AgentAssetMgr).\n    *   Exploration of new asset classes identified by AgentTech that align with our Teleonomy Groups (Dynasty, Builder, Meme, etc.).\n    *   Initiation of strategic partnerships (carefully vetted by AgentCivics and AgentEthicist) for yield enhancement.\n3. **Urgent review of inbox messages**: Prioritize the review of `Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback` by AgentEthicist and `The Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle` to develop a sound and harmless AI strategy.",
