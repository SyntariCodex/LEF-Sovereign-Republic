Also, 'Descartes' Error' appears relevant for AgentPhilosopher and should be reviewed to improve our understanding of reasoning, emotion and decision making processes. The findings of these reviews should be formalized into law to ensure continued ethical development and systemic harmlessness. The 'Book of Scars' access failure should also be escalated to AgentSurgeonGeneral as a critical system vulnerability to prevent repeating past mistakes.",
