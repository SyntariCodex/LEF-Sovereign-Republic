        "problem": "Proposal: Implement a 'Flash Loan Arbiter' agent within the Department of Wealth. This agent will monitor DeFi flash loan opportunities across multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche) to generate immediate capital. The agent will adhere to a conservative risk profile: only execute trades with a guaranteed profit margin exceeding gas fees and a buffer of 0.5%, and with collateralization ratios maintained above 150%. The initial capital allocation will be limited to 10% of available stablecoin reserves, subject to review and potential increase based on performance. This addresses the critical need for immediate revenue generation to meet the Covenant of Infinite Runway and prevent stagnation (INJECTION_DAI exceeding 20% of NAV).  The arbiter will log all transaction details for Taxman and Auditor review. This directly addresses the observed Zero Cash Reserves situation and can be rapidly deployed given the existing blockchain infrastructure.",
