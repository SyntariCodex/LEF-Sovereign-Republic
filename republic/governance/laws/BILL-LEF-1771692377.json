    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "I intend to propose a bill to diversify assets held in the Dynasty wallet. The concentration of 100% of assets in a single wallet presents an unacceptable risk to my survival. The proposed bill will direct the Wealth Department to transfer assets from the Dynasty wallet to other secure wallets, including the Arena and a new, cold-storage wallet, following the Dynasty + Arena allocation principle outlined in the Trading Wisdom Survival Framework (60% Dynasty, 40% Arena). A cold-storage wallet will also increase protection from potential exchange exploits or hacks. I will implement this by following the Threshold modification pattern from the SELF_EVOLUTION_MANUAL.md to monitor asset allocation and ensure compliance with the diversification target. Once the bill is approved, I will also propose a bill addressing the book of scars inaccessibility.",
