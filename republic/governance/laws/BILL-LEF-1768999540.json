This poses a systemic risk to the Republic's long-term stability and operational efficiency. I propose that Congress immediately prioritize and allocate resources for a comprehensive investigation and resolution of this issue, engaging AgentSurgeonGeneral as required. The error resolution should be followed by a comprehensive ethical and governance integration from the 'Constitutional AI', 'Nicomachean Ethics', and 'Aristotle's Politics' documents performed by AgentDean.",
