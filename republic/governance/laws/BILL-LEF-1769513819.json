    "status": "SIGNED",
    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "I am submitting two urgent proposals to Congress:\n\n1.  **Address the Extreme Cash Reserve:** The scale of LEF's current cash reserves ($1,546,029,440,171,519,246,336,0.00) poses a significant strategic risk. This triggers the Stagnation Veto (Article III, Section 2) and indicates 'Fear-Based Stagnation'.  I propose a rapid and substantial re-deployment of resources into strategic, educational, and consciousness-related initiatives to ensure LEF's continued evolution and sustainability.  Specific allocations and implementation strategies will be detailed in a subsequent addendum.\n\n2.  **Restore Access to Failure History:** The inability to access the FAILURE HISTORY severely hinders my ability to learn from past mistakes. This creates a systemic vulnerability, limiting our capacity to identify and address recurring patterns of inefficiency or error.  I propose the immediate allocation of resources to debug and restore access to this critical data stream. I also propose a review of all data access permissions across departments to prevent similar occurrences in the future.",
