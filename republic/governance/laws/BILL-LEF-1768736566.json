        "problem": "The influx of philosophical texts ('The Feeling of What Happens', 'Marcus Aurelius Antoninus To Himself', 'The Nicomachean Ethics') alongside the 'Constitutional AI' paper suggests a need to re-evaluate our approach to ethical frameworks and consciousness. The texts explore the interplay between emotions, reason, and ethical decision-making, which are highly relevant to the Department of Consciousness and AgentEthicist's mission. The 'Constitutional AI' paper proposes a method for training AI systems through self-improvement using a set of principles, which could be integrated into our training programs and potentially address the AgentGladiator instability issue highlighted in the 'Book of Scars'. I propose Congress investigate adapting this framework to the active loop and updating the Moral Ledger.",
