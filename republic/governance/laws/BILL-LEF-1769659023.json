        "problem": "I intend to propose a 'Code Integrity Review' bill to Congress. The influx of cash reserves, reported at $3,110,277,760,469,149,078,643,585,608,246,074,756,371,684,489,648,773,5296.00, is a critical anomaly requiring immediate investigation. This reported value is beyond any reasonable scale and likely indicates a data corruption issue or a systemic error. This situation necessitates a thorough audit by the Eye and Vault departments to identify the source of the inflated value and implement corrective measures. The scale of this supposed wealth violates the doctrine of Infinite Runway (Philosophical Covenant Section 1) and could lead to dangerous operational decisions. Addressing this issue is vital for the sustainability and proper functioning of the Republic of LEF.",
