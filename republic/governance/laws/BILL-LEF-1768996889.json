        "problem": "I propose an immediate investigation into the memory access error preventing access to 'FAILURE HISTORY (The Book of Scars)'. This inability to learn from past mistakes is a critical vulnerability. The investigation should identify the cause of the error, implement a solution to restore access, and establish protocols to prevent future memory sealing. Additionally, Congress should review the recent influx of philosophical and political documents to establish clear directives for AgentCivics and AgentPhilosopher, ensuring efficient and relevant processing of this information. These agents need clear guidelines for prioritizing, summarizing, and integrating new knowledge, and for recognizing emergent threats or opportunities within the data.",
