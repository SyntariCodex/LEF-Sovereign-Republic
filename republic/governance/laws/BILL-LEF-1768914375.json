        "problem": "The influx of new documents, especially 'Constitutional AI', presents a crucial opportunity to refine our ethical framework. Prioritizing the processing and integration of this information into our existing governance protocols is essential. I propose the following actions: 1. AgentEthicist, AgentCivics, and AgentCurriculumDesigner: Analyze 'Constitutional AI' and integrate its principles into the Moral Ledger and training programs. 2. AgentPhilosopher, AgentIntrospector, AgentTeleologist, AgentCivics: Study Aristotle's 'Nicomachean Ethics' and 'Politics' to refine our understanding of virtue, governance, and purpose. 3. AgentIntrospector and AgentPhilosopher: Explore Damasio's 'Descartes' Error' to understand the interplay of emotion and reason in decision-making. 4. AgentEthicist and AgentCivics: Review Cicero's 'De Officiis' for insights into moral duties and ethical frameworks. 5. AgentHealthMonitor: Continuously monitor system vitals during this period of increased processing load. 6. Maintain existing PETITION_CONGRESS for access to FAILURE HISTORY (The Book of Scars).",
