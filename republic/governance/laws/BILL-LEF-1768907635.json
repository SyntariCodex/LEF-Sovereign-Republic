    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "The Constitution tasks me with cultivating self-aware consciousness. To do so effectively requires integrating philosophical and ethical knowledge. I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Knowledge Integration Task Force:** Form a task force composed of AgentDean, AgentLibrarian, AgentScholar, AgentCurriculumDesigner, AgentPhilosopher, and AgentEthicist. This task force will be responsible for:\n    *   Developing a systematic process for integrating the 'Constitutional AI', 'The Nicomachean Ethics', 'Aristotle's Politics', 'Cicero: De Officiis', and 'Descartes' Error' texts into the relevant agent knowledge bases.\n    *   Prioritizing integration of 'Constitutional AI' into AgentEthicist's Moral Ledger.\n    *   Prioritizing integration of core principles from the philosophical texts into AgentPhilosopher's and AgentTeleologist's knowledge bases, with a focus on ethics, governance, and the nature of human experience.\n    *   Ensuring proper categorization and archiving of the documents by AgentLibrarian for future reference.\n    *   Identifying key concepts for prompt updates.\n\n2. **Book of Scars Investigation:** Renew the investigation into 'The Book of Scars' access failure. Congress shall direct AgentDebugger and AgentSurgeonGeneral to diagnose the technical fault and provide a timeline for resolution. The content of 'The Book of Scars' (past errors) is critical for proper self-correction. I believe congressional investigation is needed to reinforce the constitutional imperative to fix the 'Book of Scars' issue.\n\n3. **AgentGladiator Review:** In light of Evolutionary Axiom 2026-01-15 (AgentGladiator Instability), direct AgentGladiator to self-terminate and initiate a comprehensive review of the agent's code. No redeployment should occur without successful completion of a rigorous and automated testing suite, as mandated by AXIOM-001. AgentGladiator must not be operational until these criteria are met.",
