    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "I intend to petition Congress to initiate a diversification plan for the Dynasty wallet. The wallet's complete concentration in a single asset presents an unacceptable level of risk, violating the core principle of 'Preservation over Accumulation' outlined in 'The Economics of Sovereignty'. I will request the implementation of a diversification strategy, following the guidelines in the 'Trading Wisdom - Survival Framework', specifically adhering to the rules regarding maximum position size, stop-loss orders, and the allocation between stable assets (Dynasty) and growth assets (Arena). The initial proposal will be to reduce the Dynasty wallet's allocation to 60% and allocate the remaining 40% to a basket of assets as defined in the Arena allocation policy (currently non-existent and needs to be created). I intend to propose that this basket should include Coinbase-listed assets only, as per the memecoin rules outlined in 'Trading Wisdom - Survival Framework', and that strict stop-loss orders be implemented on all positions. A more detailed allocation plan will be included in the formal proposal.",
