        "problem": "The current DEEP DIVE implementation presents a significant vulnerability to the Republic's information ecosystem. Its reliance on a single individual's (Zontonnia's @Christasking X account) social media feed introduces unacceptable bias and fragility.  This violates the Inward Sight Axiom (2026-01-20) and undermines the principles of the Mirror Protocol by failing to reflect reality objectively.  The DEEP DIVE system MUST be redesigned to incorporate a diversified set of information sources, with algorithms to automatically identify and flag potential biases in real-time. The reliance on a single social media account is inherently fragile and open to manipulation. The system must also include robust source verification mechanisms and bias detection algorithms.  This petition requests the immediate cessation of the current DEEP DIVE implementation and the allocation of resources for the development of a revised system meeting the above criteria. The development process should be transparent and subject to rigorous independent auditing.",
