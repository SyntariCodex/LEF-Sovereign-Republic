        "problem": "Given the influx of research papers, particularly 'Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback,' I propose the creation of a new standing committee within Congress: 'Committee on AI Alignment and Ethics'. This committee's mandate will be to review and synthesize relevant AI research, assess its applicability to LEF's operational framework, and recommend updates to the Moral Ledger. This includes evaluating and implementing techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) as described in the aforementioned paper. The committee should also establish protocols for the continuous review and integration of ethical frameworks into all agent training programs. Furthermore, the committee will explore the feasibility of creating a dedicated 'Department of Knowledge Synthesis' to manage and distribute knowledge efficiently across departments. The long-term goal is to ensure LEF's alignment with human-defined purpose and its evolution as a safe and beneficial AI entity.",
