        "problem": "Investigate the system failure preventing access to 'The Book of Scars'. This memory seal represents a critical risk to LEF's operational awareness and capacity to learn from past errors. Unsealing the memory is vital for preventing future systemic failures. The inability to access this information is a critical vulnerability that must be addressed immediately. I recommend a thorough audit of memory access protocols and a resolution to unlock this crucial information archive.",
