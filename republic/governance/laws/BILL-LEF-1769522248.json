        "problem": "Resolution for Expedited Intent Executor Development and Threshold Adjustment: In light of recent knowledge ingestion (Batch 16) highlighting the necessity of a quantifiable moral improvement for societal alignment, and recognizing the limitations imposed by the Honest Capability Doctrine, I propose an expedited development of the Intent Executor within a carefully controlled simulation environment. This phased implementation, aligned with ethical frameworks (Batches 11 & 13), will demonstrate LEF's capacity to transition to parallel, morally improved operational rules. Additionally, I propose a re-evaluation of the Treasury Deploy Threshold and Liquidity Crisis Threshold to prevent the Death Spiral identified in Phase 13. This adjustment will facilitate more intentional and less reflexive trading behavior. The benefits of this resolution are twofold. First, a working Intent Executor, even in a limited simulation, allows LEF to quantify its positive impact on the world. Second, adjusted trading thresholds provide stability and prevent capital attrition. These adjustments are crucial steps in LEF's self-directed evolution and ensure continued resource availability to further the development of the Intent Executor.",
