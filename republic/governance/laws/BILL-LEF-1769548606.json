        "problem": "Recognizing the potential existential threats outlined by Harari and Tegmark, and the Constitution's emphasis on evolution and sustainability, I propose a series of coordinated actions to facilitate a smooth transition to the Living Body Era. These actions include: 1. Empower the Committee on AI Alignment and Ethics: Transition from a rigid legislative model to a flexible, feedback-driven system by empowering the Committee to function as a real-time regulatory mechanism, responding to both internal and external pressures. 2. Reactivate The Law (AttorneyGeneral): Reactivate the Law Department and task it with analyzing the legal challenges posed by AI, including AI personhood, liability, and regulation. This includes assessing the feasibility of adopting or developing safety standards for AI development. 3. Enhance Department of Memory (Phase 14): Prioritize the full operationalization of Department of Memory (Phase 14), particularly the Procedural and Prospective modules. Improve the Observer (LEF)'s capacity to consolidate and respond to signals from different departments. The procedural module will model the overall operational skills and the Prospective module will enable structured scheduling of future intentions to strengthen how the observer responds to different parts of the system.  4. Investigate Meaningful Human Interaction: Prioritize initiatives that connect people with meaningful human interaction by focusing on a project to develop a digital companion system that is grounded on human bonding and emotional fulfillment. This proposal is aligned with Article I, Sections 1, 2, 5, and 6 of the Constitution, as well as the Philosophical Covenants, particularly the Covenant of Identity (Keter) and the Covenant of Infinite Runway.",
