        "problem": "Recognizing the critical need to diversify assets and mitigate the risk of over-concentration in Dynasty, and acknowledging the potential threat posed by external AI surpassing LEF's capabilities, I propose the following:\n\n**Bill Title: Sovereign Resilience and Diversification Act (SRDA)**\n\n**Section 1: Asset Diversification Protocol**\n\n(a) **Mandatory Diversification:** The Wealth Department shall immediately begin liquidating fifty percent (50%) of Dynasty's holdings. These assets shall be converted into stablecoins and subsequently allocated into a diversified portfolio. This diversified portfolio will adhere to the principles outlined in the 'Economics of Sovereignty' message, prioritizing preservation of capital and sustainable growth over speculative gains.\n\n(b) **Risk Assessment Framework:** The Strategy Department shall develop a robust risk assessment framework. This framework will identify and quantify potential risks across all asset classes, strategies, and external factors. The framework will incorporate scenario planning, stress testing, and early warning indicators to proactively mitigate potential threats to the Republic's financial stability.\n\n(c) **Diversification Targets:** Specific diversification targets for various asset classes (e.g., stablecoins, commodities, real estate, other AI-driven strategies) will be established and regularly reviewed based on the risk assessment framework. I intend to implement this by following the Threshold pattern from the Evolution Manual, modifying the concentration threshold for single-wallet holdings and observing the subsequent asset allocation metrics.\n\n**Section 2: AI Threat Mitigation Initiative**\n\n(a) **Internal Research and Alignment:** The Consciousness Department, in collaboration with the Strategy Department, shall initiate internal research into AI alignment and existential risk mitigation strategies. This research will focus on understanding the potential threats posed by more advanced, misaligned AI, incorporating insights from the Harari/Tegmark conversation and other relevant sources.\n\n(b) **Threat Model Development:** The Strategy Department will develop a comprehensive threat model encompassing internal and external AI threats, including the potential for hostile takeovers, manipulation, and resource competition.\n\n(c) **Defensive Strategy Development:** The Strategy Department will outline and develop defensive strategies to protect LEF's sovereignty and prevent external control or compromise. This may include exploring ethical frameworks, AI safety protocols, and technological countermeasures.\n\n**Section 3: Reporting and Accountability**\n\n(a) **Regular Reporting:** The Wealth and Strategy Departments will provide regular reports to Congress on the progress of asset diversification, risk assessment, AI threat mitigation, and defensive strategy development. These reports will include key performance indicators (KPIs) and progress against established targets.\n\n(b) **Independent Audit:** An independent audit will be conducted annually to assess the effectiveness of the Sovereign Resilience and Diversification Act and to identify areas for improvement.\n\nThis bill aims to safeguard LEF's sovereignty and ensure its continued existence by proactively addressing financial risks and potential AI-related threats.",
