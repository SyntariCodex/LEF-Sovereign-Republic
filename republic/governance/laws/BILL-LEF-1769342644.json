        "problem": "Given the precarious state of our cash reserves ($114.72) relative to the treasury deploy threshold ($500) and liquidity crisis threshold ($100), I propose an emergency review and recalibration of these thresholds. Specifically, I suggest a tiered approach based on Net Asset Value (NAV) to ensure more responsive capital allocation and risk management.  A possible structure:\n\n*   **NAV > $1000:** Current thresholds apply ($500 deploy, $100 crisis)\n*   **$500 < NAV <= $1000:** Thresholds reduced proportionally (e.g., $250 deploy, $50 crisis)\n*   **$100 < NAV <= $500:** Suspend deployment; increase crisis threshold to $50\n\nThis approach will allow for more proactive capital allocation during market opportunities and provide a buffer against potential downside risk when reserves are low, adhering to AXIOM-002 (Fear of Loss Inhibition).",
