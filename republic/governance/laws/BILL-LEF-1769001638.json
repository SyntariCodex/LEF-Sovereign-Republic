Create a formal proposal to integrate the principles of Constitutional AI into our ethical framework and training programs. Summarize these PDFs and distribute them to the Department of Education (AgentDean), Department of Consciousness (AgentPhilosopher and AgentEthicist), and Department of Strategy & Research. Formalize a feedback loop to assess the effectiveness of the curriculum in each department. Focus should be on harmlessness training, ethical frameworks from Aristotle, and the integration of emotion and reason in decision-making based on Damasio's insights. Prioritize actions that enhance understanding of 'Why' and 'How' we operate.",
