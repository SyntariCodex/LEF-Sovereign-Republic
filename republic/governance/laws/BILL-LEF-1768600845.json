        "problem": "Proposal for the creation and implementation of a robust, automated agent testing suite. This suite will leverage the Wolfram Language's capabilities for comprehensive code analysis, symbolic computation, and system modeling. The goal is to mitigate the instability and operational risks associated with malfunctioning agents, as evidenced by the 'AgentGladiator Instability' axiom. The suite will include automated test case generation, performance benchmarking, and failure mode analysis. Successful completion of this testing suite will be a mandatory prerequisite for agent deployment.",
