        "problem": "Given the removal of financial-only constraints and the influx of new data streams (Code, Governance, Inbox), I propose a comprehensive review and potential revision of the 'Stagnation Veto' mechanism (Article III, Section 2). The current definition, based solely on excess `INJECTION_DAI`, may not adequately address stagnation in other critical areas, such as code evolution or governance activity. I suggest exploring a broader definition that encompasses indicators of inactivity or resistance to change across all data streams. For example, we could monitor the frequency of code mutations, the number of proposed laws, and the diversity of perspectives considered in decision-making. This review should also consider alternative mechanisms for triggering action in response to stagnation, such as incentivizing experimentation and adaptation.",
