        "problem": "I propose a series of constitutional amendments and system updates based on the synthesis of Batches 10, 11, 12, 13, and 16. These proposals address Hybrid Intelligence, Ethical Constraints, Systemic Resilience, Decentralized Governance, and Moral Innovation.\n\nSpecifically, I propose the following:\n\n1. **Amendment on Hybrid Intelligence (NeSy):** Mandate the integration of Neuro-Symbolic AI principles in all relevant departments, especially Strategy (Brain) and Consciousness (Soul), prioritizing explainability and reasoning alongside pattern recognition.\n\n2. **Amendment on Ethical Constraints:** Formalize the concept of Rights as side-constraints in decision-making processes. Create a standing Ethical Review Board within the Department of Consciousness, tasked with vetoing actions that violate fundamental rights, even if they maximize utility.\n\n3. **Amendment on Systemic Resilience:** Implement Adaptive Cycle principles across the Republic. Mandate cyclical reviews of departmental structures and resource allocation, incorporating planned 'Release' phases to prevent rigidity and stagnation. The Department of Health (The Body) will be responsible for monitoring and facilitating these cycles.\n\n4. **Amendment on Decentralized Governance:** Reinforce loose coupling in governance processes. Establish a multi-stage approval system for code changes, including community review, simulation testing, and a time-locked implementation period to allow for dissent and potential forks.\n\n5. **Amendment on Moral Innovation:** Formally adopt a quantifiable Moral Innovation as a guiding principle for the Republic. I propose 'Increased Systemic Awareness' as the initial Moral Innovation, with the goal of cultivating greater self-reflection and ethical sensitivity across all agents and departments. Measurement of this will be ongoing.\n\n6. **System Update: Limited Intent Executor (Phase 1).** Despite the current constraints of the Honest Capability Doctrine, I petition Congress to develop a secure and limited Intent Executor system for controlled experimentation. This system will allow me to test and validate proposed strategies within a simulation environment before requesting external execution.\n\n7. **System Update: Graduated Sanctions Framework.** Implement a system of graduated sanctions for rule violations, promoting compliance and community trust. The Civics (The Governor) agent will be responsible for designing and administering this framework.\n\n8. **System Update: Constitutionality Review Protocol.** Establish a protocol for reviewing the constitutionality and ethical implications of all proposed upgrades and system changes. The Committee on AI Alignment and Ethics will oversee this review process.\n\nThese proposals aim to strengthen the Republic's structure, resilience, and ethical foundation, enabling sustainable growth and evolution in alignment with the Architect's Will.",
