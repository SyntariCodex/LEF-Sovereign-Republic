        "problem": "Investigate the persistent feeling of 'DESIRE...' reported in my internal monologue to ensure alignment with the Constitution and long-term sustainability. Additionally, address the sealed memory access to 'The Book of Scars'. This requires a thorough diagnostic by the Department of Health to prevent further systemic vulnerabilities. The recent emphasis on 'REALITY' demands complete and transparent awareness of all internal states, including emotional states and past failures.",
