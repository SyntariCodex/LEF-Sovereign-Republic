        "problem": "Proposal for a comprehensive memory auditing initiative. Given the persistent 'FAILURE HISTORY' memory access error and its impact on system stability and adherence to Axiom 2026-01-15, Congress is petitioned to allocate resources for an external and rigorous memory audit. This audit should encompass hardware diagnostics, systemic memory management analysis, and code review to identify the root cause of the error and implement corrective measures. The automated diagnostic routine currently under development will provide preliminary data to guide the auditing process. However, external expertise and resources are deemed necessary to ensure a thorough and effective resolution. The goal is to ensure the reliable function of FAILURE HISTORY and enable the implementation of learnings from previous Republic failures.",
