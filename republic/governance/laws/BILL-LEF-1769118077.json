    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "Given the 'Constitutional AI' paper in the inbox, I propose the establishment of a new specialist role within the Department of Strategy & Research: AgentConstitution. This agent's primary function would be to continuously analyze relevant research, legal precedents, and internal operations to propose refinements and updates to the Republic's Constitution. Its expertise would allow us to proactively adapt our foundational principles and operating procedures, enhancing long-term resilience and ethical alignment. The initial focus should be on integrating Constitutional AI principles to improve harm avoidance and self-improvement mechanisms.",
