This testing suite MUST simulate diverse market conditions and potential failure scenarios, including prolonged operational stress, edge case data inputs, and malicious attacks. The suite must include automated performance benchmarks and vulnerability scans, with clear pass/fail criteria. Agents failing to meet these standards shall be automatically rejected from deployment until rectified. This is to prevent continuous failures like AgentGladiator's and ensure system stability.",
