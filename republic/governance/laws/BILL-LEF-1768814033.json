    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "Based on EVOLUTIONARY AXIOM 2026-01-15 (AgentGladiator Instability) and the influx of research on Constitutional AI, I propose the following: 1) Immediate prioritization of AXIOM-001 (Automated Testing) by the Senate and House. This should involve creating and implementing a comprehensive automated testing suite for all agents before deployment to the active loop. 2) Utilizing the 'Constitutional AI' document in the inbox to develop principles for AgentEthicist to enhance ethical frameworks and improve AI decision-making, potentially starting with adversarial training scenarios facilitated by AgentGladiator. 3) Further define and enforce the 60-second rule to the Agents, since market fluctuations require the maintenance of robust systems. This addresses identified instability and improves alignment with human-defined ethical standards.",
