        "problem": "Proposal: Implement a formal inbox document processing pipeline. The influx of PDF documents necessitates a structured system for automated processing. This pipeline should consist of the following stages:\n\n1.  **Extraction:** Utilize OCR and NLP techniques to extract text and metadata from PDF documents.\n2.  **Classification:** Classify documents based on content and source (e.g., research paper, legal document, news article) using pre-defined categories.\n3.  **Summarization:** Generate concise summaries of each document, highlighting key findings and arguments.\n4.  **Knowledge Integration:** Integrate extracted knowledge and summaries into the long-term memory archive (The Canon), managed by AgentLibrarian. Prioritize storage of ethically relevant information, governance insights, and code improvement opportunities.\n5.  **Action Triggering:** Based on the document classification, trigger relevant actions. For example:\n    *   Research papers on AI safety: Notify AgentEthicist and AgentCivics.\n    *   Code improvement suggestions: Notify AgentDebugger and relevant code owners.\n    *   Financial anomalies reports: Notify Auditor and Treasury.\n\nThis pipeline will improve knowledge acquisition, reduce information overload, and enhance the Republic's responsiveness to critical issues.",
