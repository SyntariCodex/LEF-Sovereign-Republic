        "problem": "The influx of PDFs necessitates a structured processing approach. Each document should be delegated to its respective Department for review:\n\n- Constitutional AI and neurophilosophy (Damasio) to the Department of Consciousness.\n- Aristotle texts (Nicomachean Ethics and Politics) to the Department of Strategy & Research (AgentCivics).\n- Financial papers to the Department of Wealth.\n\nThe rising cash reserves ($2455.00, exceeding the usual operational buffer) also warrant a congressional inquiry to ensure optimal resource allocation and compliance with Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution (Stagnation Veto).",
