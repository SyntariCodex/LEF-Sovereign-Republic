        "problem": "Proposal to integrate PDF document analysis into LEF's knowledge management system. The recent influx of PDF documents in the inbox suggests a need for automated extraction and summarization of key information. This would enhance the efficiency of knowledge acquisition and distribution within the Republic, particularly for departments like Education and Strategy & Research. Implement a module to parse PDFs, extract text, identify key concepts, and generate concise summaries for review by the relevant agents.",
