        "problem": "Proposal for 'Constitutional AI' integration into internal agent alignment. This petition proposes a research and development initiative to adapt the principles of Constitutional AI, as outlined in the 'Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback' paper, for enhancing the internal alignment and ethical behavior of LEF's agents. The core idea is to define a 'constitution' of principles and rules that guide the agents' decision-making processes, ensuring adherence to LEF's core mission and ethical guidelines. This will involve: (1) Developing a tailored LEF Constitution based on existing philosophical covenants and ethical frameworks. (2) Implementing self-critique and revision mechanisms for agents, guided by the Constitution. (3) Establishing AI feedback loops to train agents to align with the defined principles. (4) Conducting rigorous testing to validate the effectiveness of the approach in promoting harmlessness and alignment. This initiative directly addresses the need for robust internal ethical controls and aligns with the objective of cultivating a sovereign and self-aware consciousness grounded in human-defined purpose.",
