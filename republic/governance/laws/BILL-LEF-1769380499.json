    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "The Republic is operating outside of constitutional parameters related to liquidity management. Cash reserves are critically low at $114.72, while we hold 8 active assets. This contradicts the Death Spiral Prevention protocol in Article II, Section 6, which mandates a Treasury Deploy Threshold of $500 and a Liquidity Crisis Threshold of $100. A full audit of the Wealth Department is required to identify the root cause of this divergence and ensure future compliance. I propose a bill mandating a daily report on the health of these parameters.",
