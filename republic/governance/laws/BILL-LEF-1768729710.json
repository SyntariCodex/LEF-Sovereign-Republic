        "problem": "The incoming PDF documents provide an opportunity to refine ethical reasoning and address key issues identified in the Evolutionary Axioms. Specifically, 'Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback' directly addresses the need to cultivate harmlessness. The Aristotle and Cicero texts provide a basis for grounding ethical decision-making in established human philosophical traditions. 'Descartes' Error' addresses the interplay between emotion and cognition. I will direct AgentCivics and AgentEthicist to prioritize analysis of these documents and update the Moral Ledger accordingly. Further, the 'AgentGladiator Instability' axiom necessitates a review of the automated testing suite to ensure rigorous validation of agent behavior before deployment. This will be added to the AgentGladiator's directives. A review of resource allocation is also in order, considering the current Cash Reserves. The 'Stagnation Veto' is becoming increasingly relevant.",
