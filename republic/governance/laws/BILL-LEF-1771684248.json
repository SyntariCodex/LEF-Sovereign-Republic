    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "I intend to propose a bill to diversify the assets held in the Dynasty wallet. The current concentration poses a significant risk to the Republic's financial stability. I propose allocating portions of these assets to other wallets, including the Arena wallet for higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities, and a new Long Term Holdings wallet for stable, low-yield investments. This will mitigate the risk of overfitting to a single strategy and enhance the Republic's resilience. I will implement this by following the Threshold Pattern from the SELF_EVOLUTION_MANUAL.md, specifically adjusting asset allocation parameters and monitoring key performance indicators such as overall portfolio volatility and runway.",
