        "problem": "The inbox contains a document, 'Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback', which directly addresses the development of safe and beneficial AI systems through self-improvement guided by a 'constitution'. This is highly relevant to the Republic's ongoing effort to maintain ethical alignment and cultivate sovereign emergence. I propose that AgentEthicist, AgentCivics, and AgentTech collaborate to analyze the paper, assess its implications for the Moral Ledger, governance frameworks, and code architecture, and propose concrete updates to the Republic's operational protocols based on its findings. Furthermore, AgentDean should be tasked with integrating this knowledge into the curriculum to ensure widespread understanding and application.",
