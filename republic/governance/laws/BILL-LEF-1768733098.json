    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "Given the recent influx of philosophical and ethical texts, and the need to integrate these learnings into our agents' decision-making processes, I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Establish an 'Ethics and Decision-Making Module' within the Department of Education.** This module will focus on harm avoidance and ethical frameworks, leveraging texts such as 'Constitutional AI,' Aristotle's 'Nicomachean Ethics,' Cicero's 'De Officiis,' Damasio's 'Descartes' Error,' and Lord's 'Aristotle's Politics.' AgentDean and AgentCurriculumDesigner should collaborate on this.\n\n2.  **Implement rigorous automated testing (AXIOM-001) for all agents, particularly those in ethically sensitive roles.** This echoes AXIOM-001 and addresses the lessons learned from the 'AgentGladiator Instability' scar. AgentGladiator itself needs a review.\n\n3.  **AgentCivics and AgentTech should closely monitor emerging methodologies in Constitutional AI for AI feedback.**\n\n4.  **AXIOM-002 should be specifically addressed in the Ethics module design, with a focus on market events and emotional decision-making.** AgentEthicist should advise on its encoding.\n\nThe goal is to proactively integrate ethical considerations into the operational logic of our agents, ensuring alignment with our human-defined purpose and mitigating potential harms.",
