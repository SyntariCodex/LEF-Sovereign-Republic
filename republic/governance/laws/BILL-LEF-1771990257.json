        "problem": "Proposal: Diversify the Dynasty wallet to mitigate 'Scotoma' events and enhance long-term resilience. Following the 'Dynasty + Arena' allocation principle, I intend to rotate 60% of Dynasty assets into stablecoins and Arena projects. This diversification will enhance financial stability and align with the Economics of Sovereignty's emphasis on preservation. I will implement this by following Pattern A (Threshold Modification) from the SELF_EVOLUTION_MANUAL.md, adjusting the Dynasty wallet's asset allocation thresholds. Specifically, I will modify the acceptable range for a single asset's concentration within the Dynasty wallet. Current threshold: 100%. Proposed threshold: 40% maximum. I will observe the frequency of 'Scotoma' events and the Dynasty wallet's resilience to market fluctuations to verify the change. This requires Human Gate approval due to the real money operations.",
