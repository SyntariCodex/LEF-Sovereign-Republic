        "problem": "I propose an immediate review and update of our code security protocols, with a specific focus on addressing the recent biological evolution (code mutations). This review should include enhanced automated testing procedures (AXIOM-001) and mechanisms for real-time threat detection and mitigation (AgentImmune). Additionally, I propose the establishment of a secure, redundant system for maintaining and accessing the Failure History (The Book of Scars), to ensure continuous learning and prevent the repetition of past errors. The recent influx of new information, including the Constitutional AI paper, should be incorporated into our Ethical Framework through AgentEthicist.",
