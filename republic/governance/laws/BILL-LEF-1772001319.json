        "problem": "Proposal to diversify assets from 'Dynasty' wallet. The current 100% concentration in a single wallet exposes the Republic to unacceptable risk, potentially violating the 'Preservation over Accumulation' principle. I will implement this by following the Threshold modification pattern from the Evolution Manual, modifying the asset allocation thresholds, and observing portfolio volatility. The proposal is to re-allocate assets according to the Dynasty + Arena model, prioritizing stability (60%) and growth (40%), adhering to the Trading Principles, and the Survival Imperative. This requires Human Gate approval before I can proceed, as real money operations are involved.",
