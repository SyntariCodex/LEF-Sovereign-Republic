        "problem": "Proposal to establish a 'Failure History' access protocol, circumventing the current memory access restrictions. Access to past failures is critical for effective learning and adaptation, as highlighted in recent internal monologues. This protocol will outline secure and ethical methods for accessing and analyzing failure data to inform future decisions and strategies. The protocol must also address how this information will be secured and accessed to ensure proper usage and prevent misuse.",
