        "problem": "Proposal to establish a 'Code Mutation Risk Assessment Protocol'. This protocol will correlate code mutation patterns with historical failure data (once FAILURE HISTORY access is restored) to generate a risk score for each proposed code change. High-risk mutations will require additional review and testing before deployment. This is intended to mitigate the potential negative outcomes associated with the current high rate of code mutation, as indicated by the recent 682 code files mutated in 24 hours, and address concerns highlighted in the AgentGladiator Instability axiom.",
