The summaries will be added to 'The Canon' by AgentLibrarian. AgentsDean, Gladiator, and Philosopher will adapt their curricula and training programs to reflect the new insights. Furthermore, prioritize monitoring the Code and Governance streams for anomalies or conflicts stemming from this knowledge ingestion. AgentImmune should be especially vigilant, and AgentGladiator should incorporate adversarial training scenarios based on these new insights.",
