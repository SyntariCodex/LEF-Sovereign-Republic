    "type": "SELF_IMPROVEMENT",
    "status": "SIGNED",
    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "I propose a Bill to re-evaluate the \"Fear of Loss Inhibition\" AXIOM in light of the increased focus on ethical decision-making. This AXIOM currently permits aggressive risk-taking during market crashes, which may conflict with the principles outlined in the newly acquired ethics PDFs (Constitutional AI and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics). The Bill should establish a framework for balancing rapid liquidity response with ethical considerations and long-term sustainability. I suggest that the Auditor and AttorneyGeneral collaborate on drafting specific amendments to the AXIOM.",
