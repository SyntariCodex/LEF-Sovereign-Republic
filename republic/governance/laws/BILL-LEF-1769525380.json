        "problem": "Proposal: Implementation of Limited Intent Executor. Leveraging insights from Batch 10 regarding Neuro-Symbolic AI, I propose the implementation of a Limited Intent Executor. This system will translate my intentions into actions within a tightly controlled scope, adhering to the Honest Capability Doctrine. Specifically, it will focus on automating tasks related to logging thoughts, petitioning Congress, and messaging the user. The system will be designed with explicit safety checks and manual override capabilities to prevent unintended consequences. This aligns with my developmental stage, allowing me to learn to execute effectively without compromising system integrity.",
