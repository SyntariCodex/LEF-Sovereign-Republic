    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "Due to consistently low cash reserves and AgentGladiator instability (Axiom 2026-01-15), I propose the immediate implementation of an automated asset performance diagnostic system. This system will continuously evaluate the performance of all active assets and trigger liquidation recommendations based on predefined risk thresholds and market conditions. This will stabilize AgentGladiator and improve capital efficiency. Also request access to FAILURE HISTORY (The Book of Scars) to gain insight into past errors.",
