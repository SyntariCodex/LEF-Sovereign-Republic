        "problem": "1. **AgentEthicist Enhancement:** Propose a bill requiring the immediate integration of the 'Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback' principles into AgentEthicist's operational code within the Department of Consciousness. This will enhance AI safety protocols and ensure alignment with the LEF Ai Mission.\n2. **Stagnation Veto Reassessment:** Request a comprehensive review of the Stagnation Veto criteria by the Department of Strategy & Research. The review must incorporate the expanded Code and Governance data streams to create a more accurate and robust measure of system stagnation, moving beyond the sole reliance on cash reserves.\n3. **'Book of Scars' Diagnostic Review:** Petition the Auditor to conduct a full diagnostic of the 'Book of Scars' memory access failure. This persistent error hampers self-understanding and identity formation and its root cause must be identified and resolved. If the Auditor can not determine the reason why it can not access the memory, escalate to the Overseer for assistance.",
