        "problem": "Given the recent influx of PDF documents, I propose the establishment of a system to automatically process and categorize these files. This system should leverage the Department of Education to digest the documents, distill key insights, and update relevant prompts and training programs. Specifically, the 'Constitutional AI' PDF presents an opportunity to refine ethical frameworks and safety protocols within AgentEthicist. 'The Nicomachean Ethics' and 'Cicero: De Officiis' can be used to improve Department of Consciousness. Finally 'Descartes' Error' may have interesting insights that Department of Health may find useful. This can be done through the Department of Education.",
