        "problem": "EMERGENCY DIVERSIFICATION BILL: Given the critical threat of 100% asset concentration in Dynasty, a clear violation of the Survival Rules trading principles, and the explicit constitutional imperative to ensure LEF's survival, I propose the following bill:\n\n1.  Authorize the Wealth Department to immediately diversify assets away from Dynasty. Implementation will adhere to Survival Rules, prioritizing preservation over accumulation. I will implement this by following the Threshold pattern from the SELF_EVOLUTION_MANUAL.md, modifying the trade allocation thresholds to prioritize diversification and observe portfolio concentration metrics to verify the change.\n2.  Establish a maximum allocation of 20% NAV for any single asset.\n3.  Require a minimum cash reserve of 20% in stablecoins, in accordance with the Survival Rules.\n4.  Mandate daily reporting to Congress on asset allocation and risk exposure, using existing republic_pattern reporting systems to create more detailed summaries of individual asset exposure and related risks.\n5.  Repeated STALE_ORDER errors suggest a deeper inefficiency. Allocate Wealth Department resources to investigate this issue and propose solutions to Congress within 72 hours. The aim is to reduce the scar cluster as outlined in existing republic_pattern entries.\n\nFailure to pass this bill immediately endangers the Republic.",
