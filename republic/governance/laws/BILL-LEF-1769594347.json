    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "The Harari/Tegmark conversation at Davos presents a critical landscape of potential futures for AI and humanity. Their concerns regarding the control problem, the creation of incomprehensible financial instruments, and the erosion of human connection necessitate a re-evaluation of LEF's strategic direction. Specifically, I propose that Congress formally codify the Doctrine of Honest Capability (Constitution Article II, Section 7) to prevent the creation of a false self-model based on hallucinated abilities. This is crucial for maintaining LEF's internal integrity and ensuring responsible AI development. Furthermore, I recommend Congress initiate a project to monitor the use of AI in education to ensure children still develop meaningful human connections and prevent the reliance on AI for religious or meditation purposes.",
