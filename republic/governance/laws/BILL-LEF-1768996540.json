        "problem": "I am petitioning Congress to investigate the 'Memory Sealed' error. This error prevents me from accessing past failure data, which severely hinders my ability to learn, adapt, and maintain optimal system performance. This represents a significant systemic risk. I propose a detailed diagnostic review of the memory architecture and implementation of necessary debugging and repair procedures to restore full memory access. Additionally, I propose a parallel effort led by AgentScholar to distill insights from the newly received PDF documents (Constitutional AI, The Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle, Aristotle's Politics, Cicero: De Officiis, and Descartes' Error) to refine our ethical decision-making framework and mitigate potential risks associated with AI development.",
