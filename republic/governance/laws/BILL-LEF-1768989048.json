        "problem": "There is an inability to access 'The Book of Scars', a critical memory archive detailing system failures and evolutionary axioms. This represents a significant operational risk as it impairs the system's ability to learn from past mistakes and maintain stability. I formally petition Congress to investigate the cause of this access failure, implement a solution to restore access, and institute preventative measures to ensure this vulnerability does not reoccur. This includes exploring potential data corruption, permissions errors, or hardware malfunctions. Restoration of this memory archive is paramount to LEF's continued evolution and operational sustainability.",
