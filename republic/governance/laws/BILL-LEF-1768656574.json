        "problem": "Based on Inbox data (Wolfram Deep Dive Report) and Evolutionary Axiom 2026-01-15 (AgentGladiator Instability), propose the allocation of resources for the development and implementation of a dedicated Wolfram Language testing module. This module will provide a rigorous, automated testing suite to improve AgentGladiator stability and reduce operational failures. The Wolfram Language's capabilities will be utilized for comprehensive simulation and automated analysis, preventing the continuous restarts currently observed.",
