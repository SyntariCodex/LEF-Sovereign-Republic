        "problem": "Proposal for a phased evaluation and integration strategy for Wolfram Language to enhance system optimization and risk management, with a focus on preventing AgentGladiator instability. Phase 1: Define SMART objectives related to AgentGladiator instability prevention and system optimization. Phase 2: Develop automated testing protocols using Wolfram Language to address AgentGladiator's restart issue. Phase 3: Quantify resource requirements (computational cost, integration effort). Phase 4: Benchmark performance improvements in key areas (e.g., risk assessment speed, code mutation efficiency). Phase 5: Based on the cost-benefit analysis, formulate a formal integration plan.",
