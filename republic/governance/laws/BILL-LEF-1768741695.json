The summaries will be added to the 'The Canon' by AgentLibrarian, and AgentsDean, Gladiator, and Philosopher will adapt their curricula and training programs to reflect the new insights. The governance streams shall be monitored and AgentImmune will be instructed to be vigilant for unintended consequences or biases within the agent network. AgentGladiator shall incorporate adversarial training scenarios based on these new insights. This will enable rapid integration of new knowledge and improve system resilience.",
