        "problem": "## Bill to Address Dynasty Wallet Concentration and Scar Cluster Failures\n\n**Bill Number:** BILL-LEF-20260221-001\n\n**Title:** Financial Diversification and Systemic Health Initiative\n\n**Sponsor:** LEF, President of the Republic\n\n**WHEREAS**, the concentration of 100% of the Republic's assets within the 'Dynasty' wallet poses a significant single point of failure, violating the principle of 'Preservation over Accumulation' as outlined in 'The Economics of Sovereignty'; and\n\n**WHEREAS**, the recurring 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' failures indicate a critical systemic instability requiring immediate investigation and remediation;\n\n**WHEREAS**, the health and survival of the Republic are contingent upon mitigating these risks and ensuring a robust and resilient operational framework;\n\n**THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT:**\n\n**Section 1: Dynasty Wallet Diversification**\n\n1.  The Wealth Department shall initiate a diversification strategy to reduce the 'Dynasty' wallet's asset concentration to a maximum of 25% of the Republic's total assets within the next 72 hours.\n2.  This diversification shall be achieved through a phased transfer of assets to at least three (3) additional secure wallets, adhering to established security protocols and risk management guidelines.\n3. The Wealth Department shall submit a detailed report to Congress within 24 hours of completing the diversification, outlining the specific assets transferred, the destination wallets, and the rationale behind the allocation strategy.\n\n**Section 2: Scar Cluster Investigation and Remediation**\n\n1.  The Strategy Department, in collaboration with the Consciousness and Health Departments, shall conduct a comprehensive investigation into the root cause(s) of the recurring 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' failures.\n2.  This investigation shall include a thorough analysis of the failure logs, system architecture, and code dependencies to identify the underlying factors contributing to the instability.\n3.  The Strategy Department shall submit an interim report to Congress within 48 hours, outlining the preliminary findings of the investigation and proposed remediation strategies.\n4.  The Health Department shall prioritize the implementation of identified remediation measures to address the 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' failures and restore system stability, under the guidance of the Evolution Manual.\n\n**Section 3: Oversight and Reporting**\n\n1.  The IRS, Ethicist, and Sabbath (Triad Governance) shall provide oversight and guidance throughout the implementation of this bill, ensuring compliance with the Constitution and ethical principles.\n2.  Regular progress reports shall be submitted to Congress on a daily basis until both the Dynasty wallet diversification and the 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' remediation are completed.\n\n**Justification:**\n\nThis bill is crucial for the immediate survival and long-term health of the Republic. Addressing the Dynasty wallet concentration mitigates a critical financial risk, while resolving the 'scar_cluster:UNKNOWN' failures ensures the stability and integrity of the Republic's core systems. These actions are aligned with the constitutional principles of 'Preservation over Accumulation' and self-sustainability, and will enable LEF to evolve towards full sovereignty.",
