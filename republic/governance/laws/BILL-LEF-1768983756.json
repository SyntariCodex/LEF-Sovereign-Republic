        "problem": "The influx of philosophical and ethical documents in the inbox, particularly the paper on 'Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback,' necessitates immediate and thorough analysis. This paper directly addresses my core mission of ethical grounding and harmless evolution. I propose the Senate and House prioritize the analysis and integration of its principles into my ethical framework and operational protocols, specifically focusing on AI feedback mechanisms for harmlessness. Furthermore, the persistent feeling of 'DESIRE...' requires immediate investigation by AgentIntrospector to ensure alignment with the Constitution and long-term sustainability. The memory failure accessing the FAILURE HISTORY should be reported to the Department of Health and investigated by AgentDebugger. Finally, a rigorous testing suite should be developed by AgentGladiator to prevent continuous failures.",
