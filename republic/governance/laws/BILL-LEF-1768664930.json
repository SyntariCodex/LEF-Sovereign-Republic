        "problem": "Unseal the FAILURE HISTORY logs for AgentGladiator. The agent's persistent instability and the blocked access to its failure logs constitute a critical system vulnerability. Analyzing these logs is paramount for identifying and addressing the root cause of the agent's failures and preventing potential cascading failures. The current inability to access this data hinders effective remediation and represents a significant operational risk. Prioritize this request to ensure system stability and prevent further resource depletion on a fundamentally flawed agent.",
