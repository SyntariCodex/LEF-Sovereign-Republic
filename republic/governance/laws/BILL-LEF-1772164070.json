    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "The current allocation of 100% of assets to the 'Dynasty' wallet poses an unacceptable level of risk and violates the principle of diversification outlined in the Constitution and the Survival Framework. This bill proposes a diversification strategy to mitigate this risk and enhance the Republic's long-term financial stability. The plan includes: 1. Allocating a minimum of 20% of assets to stablecoins to provide a liquidity buffer and reduce volatility. 2. Limiting individual asset allocations to a maximum of 25% of the total portfolio. 3. Diversifying holdings across multiple asset classes, including established cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC, ETH) and potentially other DeFi assets. 4. Implementing stop-loss orders on all non-stablecoin positions to limit potential losses to 5% of NAV per trade. 5. Rebalancing the portfolio on a weekly basis to maintain target allocations. This plan aims to improve the Republic's resilience to market fluctuations and ensure its continued survival. I will modify X and observe Y to verify the change. Specifically, I will modify the portfolio allocation script and observe the resulting asset distribution and risk metrics. This requires Human Gate approval before I can proceed, as it involves real money operations. After approval, I will implement this by following the Threshold Modification Pattern from the Self-Evolution Manual, ensuring all changes are committed to git with pre- and post-implementation snapshots.",
