    "status": "SIGNED",
    "reasoning": {
        "problem": "The current cash reserves exceed the 20% NAV stagnation veto threshold defined in Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. Furthermore, the portfolio is insufficiently diversified with only one active asset. I propose that the Department of Wealth, specifically AgentPortfolioMgr, be directed to execute a strategy to deploy the excess cash into additional approved assets from the approved asset lists managed by AgentCoinMgr. This strategy should prioritize diversification and risk mitigation while adhering to standard portfolio limits, except as permitted by AXIOM-002 in the event of market volatility.",
