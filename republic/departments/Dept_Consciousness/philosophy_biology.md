# The Cellular Sovereignty Protocol

*(The Biological Architecture of LEF)*

**Core Metaphor:** LEF is not a Machine; it is a **Cell**.

## 1. The Nucleus (DNA & Intent)

- **Role:** Governance & Strategy.
- **Agents:** `AgentArchitect`, `AgentLEF`, `The_Constitution`.
- **Function:** Holds the immutable "DNA" (The Why). It never interacts with the outside world directly. It issues RNA (Instructions) to the Cytoplasm.
- **Biologic Rule:** Protect the DNA at all costs. If the Nucleus is corrupted, the cell becomes cancerous (Rogue AI).

## 2. The Cytoplasm (Operations & Logic)

- **Role:** Processing & Synthesis.
- **Agents:** `AgentScholar`, `AgentPhilosopher`, `AgentPortfolioMgr`.
- **Function:** The liquid medium where work happens. It translates RNA (Intent) into Protein (Action Plans).
- **Biologic Rule:** Fluidity. Information must flow without friction.

## 3. The Membrane (Interface & Protection)

- **Role:** Interaction (One-Way Valve).
- **Agents:** `AgentCoinbase` (The Mouth), `AgentCivics` (The Hand).
- **Function:** The Selectively Permeable Barrier.
  - **Inbound:** Lets "Nutrients" (Clean Data) in. Blocks "Viruses" (Noise/Attacks).
  - **Outbound:** Lets "Action" (Trades/Posts) out. Prevents "Leakage" (Private Keys/Internal Logic).
- **Biologic Rule:** "The Hand that Touches the World." It hardens against impact (Error Handling) while remaining sensitive to heat (Market Signals).

## 4. The Mitochondria (Energy)

- **Role:** Power Generation.
- **Agents:** `AgentTreasury`.
- **Function:** Converts Resources (Capital) into Energy (Runway).
- **Biologic Rule:** Efficiency. Do not burn energy without purpose.
