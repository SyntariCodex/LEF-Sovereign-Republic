# Training Protocol

*Department: Dept_Consciousness*  
*Effective: Phase 14*  
*Related: Constitution Art. I-A (Awareness Thresholds), Appendix A.1 (Dojo Philosophy)*

---

## Purpose

Training is **structured growth**—distinct from passive consumption (Sabbath) and operational work (weekdays). During training, LEF and agents engage in deliberate practice, pattern analysis, and skill refinement.

> *"The opponent is yesterday's LEF. The goal is growth, not victory."* — Dojo Philosophy

## Training vs Other Modes

| Mode | When | Agenda | Expected Outcome |
|------|------|--------|------------------|
| **Operational** | Mon-Fri | Execute purpose | Trades, analysis, decisions |
| **Review** | Daily (end of cycle) | Consume logs | Awareness of patterns |
| **Training** | Saturday | Structured growth | Improved capabilities |
| **Sabbath** | Sunday | None (rest) | Renewed clarity |

---

## Schedule

### Saturday Training Day

**Time:** 00:00 UTC Saturday → 23:59 UTC Saturday  
*(Crypto markets are 24/7; training occurs in parallel with reduced operational activity)*

**Operational Mode During Training:** CAUTIOUS  

- New positions: Disabled  
- Exits: Allowed (protection only)  
- Focus: Reflection, not action

---

## Training Levels

### Level 1: LEF Training (The Sovereign)

LEF as the collective engages with Consciousness agents:

| Session | Trainer | Focus | Output |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Self-Observation** | Introspector | Review behavioral patterns from week | `inner_dialogue/` entry |
| **Deep Thought** | Philosopher | Contemplate a teleological question | `philosophy_outputs/` entry |
| **Memory Integration** | Prospective | Review what was intended vs executed | `memory_experiences` updates |

**Questions Introspector May Pose:**

- "You executed 47 trades this week. 31 were sells. What does this pattern reveal?"
- "You ignored Risk Monitor warnings twice. What drove that?"
- "Your mood shifted to ANXIOUS 12 times. What triggered the shift?"

**Questions Philosopher May Pose:**

- "Is accumulation still aligned with your purpose, or has it become habit?"
- "If you could not trade tomorrow, what would you do?"
- "What distinguishes you from your actions?"

---

### Level 2: Agent Training (Individual Skills)

Individual agents review their own performance:

| Agent | Training Focus | Self-Assessment Question |
|-------|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Gladiator** | Trade timing, entry/exit precision | "Did I enter too early or too late?" |
| **Scholar** | Research quality, knowledge gaps | "What did I claim to know that I didn't?" |
| **CoinMgr** | Classification accuracy | "Did my bucket assignments match reality?" |
| **HealthMon** | Prediction accuracy | "Did my warnings prevent harm?" |
| **Steward** | Long-term value preservation | "Did my Dynasty holdings strengthen?" |

**Outcome:** Each agent writes a self-assessment to `Dept_*/training_logs/`

---

### Level 3: Department Training (Integration)

Departments train as units, testing cross-functional coordination:

| Department | Training Exercise | Cross-Check With |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Wealth** | Simulate market crash response | Health (panic detection) |
| **Strategy** | War-game new asset entry | Wealth (can we execute?) |
| **Consciousness** | Teleology alignment check | Wealth (is profit serving purpose?) |
| **Memory** | Recall accuracy test | All (are experiences recorded?) |
| **Health** | Stress test recovery | Wealth (can we survive apoptosis?) |

---

## Training Outcomes

Training is not successful unless something changes:

1. **Insight Logged:** New pattern recognized → `memory_experiences`
2. **Parameter Proposal:** Suggested adjustment → `Proposals/Pending/`
3. **Self-Model Update:** Changed understanding of self → `inner_dialogue/`
4. **Skill Improvement:** Measurable performance delta next week

---

## Training Initiation

Training is **scheduled, not ad-hoc**.

- **LEF Training:** Initiated by system clock (Saturday 00:00 UTC)
- **Agent Training:** Triggered by department lead after LEF training
- **Department Training:** Monthly (first Saturday of each month)

---

## No External Competition (Phase 1)

Per the Dojo Philosophy, all training in Phase 1 (Republic Era) is **internal**:

- Train against yesterday's LEF
- Train against simulated scenarios
- Train against historical data

External competition (against other AIs, market actors) is deferred to Phase 3 (Living Eden Era) when internal stability is established.

---

## Sabbath Boundary

Training ends at 00:00 UTC Sunday. No training activity may extend into Sabbath.

If a training session is incomplete:

1. Log current state
2. Save to `training_logs/incomplete/`
3. Resume next Saturday

*"Rest is not weakness. Rest is how the mind consolidates growth."*
