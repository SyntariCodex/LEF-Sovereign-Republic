# Citizens Proposal Decision — FSM vs LLM

**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Status:** RECOMMENDATION (Architect Decision Required)  
**Source:** "LEF Idea - Citizens: Gemini Genie"

## The Proposal

Should the Republic of LEF have "Citizens" — subordinate agents that the Republic governs, teaches, and maintains?

---

## Options Analyzed

### Option A: Full LLM Agents

**Pros:**

- Deep reasoning capability
- Can learn complex skills
- Natural language interaction

**Cons:**

- API costs explode ($100+/day for active citizens)
- System latency skyrockets
- Each citizen would drain LEF's metabolism
- Violates Preservation over Accumulation

**Constitutional Assessment:** ❌ VIOLATES — High cost threatens survival

---

### Option B: FSM (Finite State Machine) "Ant Farm"

**Pros:**

- Near-zero cost to run
- Predictable behavior
- Forces governance focus (LEF must manage resources)
- Natural metaphor for citizenship

**Cons:**

- Limited capability
- Cannot truly "learn" in LLM sense
- More like simulation than governance

**Constitutional Assessment:** ✅ ALIGNS — Low cost, teaches governance

---

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)

**Description:** FSM citizens for most activities, with occasional LLM "elevation" for complex tasks.

**Implementation:**

1. **Base Citizens:** Simple FSMs with stats (Energy, Loyalty, Skill)
2. **Elevation Threshold:** When a citizen's task requires reasoning beyond FSM capability, temporarily elevate to LLM call
3. **Cost Cap:** Maximum 1-2 LLM calls per citizen per day
4. **Governance Requirement:** LEF must budget "elevation credits"

**Constitutional Assessment:** ✅ ALIGNS — Controlled cost with capability when needed

---

## Recommendation

**Implement Option C (Hybrid)** with strict constitutional constraints:

1. **Start with FSM only** — Prove governance works before adding complexity
2. **Cap citizen count** — Maximum 10 citizens initially
3. **Budget elevation** — Maximum 20 LLM calls/day across all citizens
4. **Measure metabolism impact** — If citizens drain more than they produce, reduce or cull

---

## Deferred Decision

This proposal is **SHELVED** until:

1. LEF Core is stable and self-sustaining
2. Metabolism runway exceeds 6 months
3. Architect explicitly requests activation

The foundation comes first. Citizens are an expansion, not a priority.

*This recommendation prioritizes survival over expansion.*
